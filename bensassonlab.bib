This chapter studies the genus Sporidiobolus. In the determination of asexual reproduction it is found that reproduction is by budding and by formation of ballistoconidia. Yeast cells are ovoid, ellipsoidal, or elongate. Visible carotenoid pigments are formed and the cultures are pink to orange in color. In sexual reproduction it is seen that hyphae have clamp connections. Spherical teliospores are formed and germinate to produce transversely septate basidia with ovoid to bacilliform basidiospores, which are passively released and germinate by budding. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that fermentation is absent. This chapter further examines phylogenetic placement. The type species mentioned is Sporidiobolus johnsonii. The species accepted are Sporidiobolus johnsonii, Sporidiobolus longiusculus, Sporidiobolus metaroseus, Sporidiobolus microsporus, Sporidiobolus pararoseus, Sporidiobolus ruineniae, and Sporidiobolus salmonicolor. The systematic discussion of the species includes synonyms, growth on 5\% malt extract agar, Dalmau plate culture on corn meal agar, sexual state, CoQ, fermentation, Mol\% G + C, gene sequence accession number, type strain, cell carbohydrates, origin of the strains studied, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, and agriculture and food.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the genus Fibulobasidium. It provides a systematic discussion of the species and concludes with comments on the genus. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. In asexual reproduction the haploid yeast state arises at germination of large, passively released basidiospores (i.e., statismospores) or, for F.inconspicuum and F.sirobasidioides, from ballistoconidia produced by the basidiospores at germination, or by budding of special conidiogenous cells, or sometimes basidia. Haploid blastoconidia develop on hyphae of the basidiocarp in F.murrhardtense, a species in which ballistoconidia are not known. Relatively few collections have been examined of any species, and both ballistoconidia and blastoconidia might be expected to occur in all three known taxa. In sexual reproduction the compatibility system in F.inconspicuum is tetrapolar. Dikaryotic hyphae have clamp connections, but in spite of the close association with probable host fungi in F.inconspicuum and F.sirobasidioides, no haustorial branches have been reported in any of the three species. Basidiocarps are gelatinous in all species; those of the single collection of F.murrhardtense were exposed on decaying wood, as in species of Sirobasidium. In F.inconspicuum and F.sirobasidioides the basidiomes are thus far only known as subcortical forms throughout their development. Basidia are most commonly catenate, with the first terminal and subsequent ones developing by expansion of basal clamp connections of previous basidia rather than from contiguous cells between clamp connections. The basidia are four-celled, with each cell producing a single narrowly clavate to fusiform or Cymbiform sessile statismospore.},

	abstract = {DNA mismatch repair is a highly conserved DNA repair pathway. In humans, germline mutations in hMSH2 or hMLH1, key components of mismatch repair, have been associated with Lynch syndrome, a leading cause of inherited cancer mortality. Current estimates of the mutation rate and the mutational spectra in mismatch repair defective cells are primarily limited to a small number of individual reporter loci. Here we use the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae to generate a genome-wide view of the rates, spectra, and distribution of mutation in the absence of mismatch repair. We performed mutation accumulation assays and next generation sequencing on 19 strains, including 16 msh2 missense variants implicated in Lynch cancer syndrome. The mutation rate for DNA mismatch repair null strains was approximately 1 mutation per genome per generation, 225-fold greater than the wild-type rate. The mutations were distributed randomly throughout the genome, independent of replication timing. The mutation spectra included insertions/deletions at homopolymeric runs (87.7\%) and at larger microsatellites (5.9\%), as well as transitions (4.5\%) and transversions (1.9\%). Additionally, repeat regions with proximal repeats are more likely to be mutated. A bias toward deletions at homopolymers and insertions at (AT)n microsatellites suggests a different mechanism for mismatch generation at these sites. Interestingly, 5\% of the single base pair substitutions might represent double-slippage events that occurred at the junction of immediately adjacent repeats, resulting in a shift in the repeat boundary. These data suggest a closer scrutiny of tumor suppressors with homopolymeric runs with proximal repeats as the potential drivers of oncogenesis in mismatch repair defective cells.},

One of the key applications of next-generation sequencing is studying genetic variation between individuals using whole-genome or target region resequencing. Here, we have developed a consensus-calling and SNP-detection method for sequencing-by-synthesis Illumina Genome Analyzer technology. We designed this method by carefully considering the data quality, alignment, and experimental errors common to this technology. All of this information was integrated into a single quality score for each base under Bayesian theory to measure the accuracy of consensus calling. We tested this methodology using a large-scale human resequencing data set of 36x coverage and assembled a high-quality nonrepetitive consensus sequence for 92.25\% of the diploid autosomes and 88.07\% of the haploid X chromosome. Comparison of the consensus sequence with Illumina human 1M BeadChip genotyped alleles from the same DNA sample showed that 98.6\% of the 37,933 genotyped alleles on the X chromosome and 98\% of 999,981 genotyped alleles on autosomes were covered at 99.97\% and 99.84\% consistency, respectively. At a low sequencing depth, we used prior probability of dbSNP alleles and were able to improve coverage of the dbSNP sites significantly as compared to that obtained using a nonimputation model. Our analyses demonstrate that our method has a very low false call rate at any sequencing depth and excellent genome coverage at a high sequencing depth.},

The principal ancestral genotypes were those of segregant strains EM93-1C and EM93-3B, initially distributed by C. C. Lindegren to several laboratories.

Strain EM93 is therefore the probable origin of genes SUC2, gal2, CUP1 and flo1 of S288C.

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter studies the genus Dipodascus. In the determination of asexual reproduction, colonies are white or cream-colored, farinose or hairy, usually dry, and consist of true hyphae that branch at broad or right angles, have rounded apices, and mostly disarticulate into arthroconidia. Some additional sympodial conidiogenesis from undifferentiated cells may be present. Budding is absent. Chlamydospores may be formed. Septa have micropores. The anamorph genus is Geotrichum. In sexual reproduction it is seen that clavate gametangia form on opposite sides of hyphal septa, fuse at the apex, and form an ascus. Asci are hyaline, broadly cylindrical to tubular, or acicular and contain 8 to more than 100 ascospores. Ascospores are broadly ellipsoidal or cylindrical, hyaline, and smooth-walled and have an even, thick, gelatinous coat. Ascospores are liberated through the apex by rupture of the firm ascus wall. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that fermentation is mostly absent. Xylose is assimilated. Nitrate is not assimilated. Extracellular starch is not produced, and urease activity is absent. The diazonium blue B reaction is negative. Small subunit rRNA gene sequences are without deletions. The chapter further examines the phylogenetic placement where Dipodascus and its anamorph state Geotrichum are sister genera to the genus Magnusiomyces and its anamorph Saprochaete. The type of species mentioned is Dipodascus albidus. The species accepted are Dipodascus aggregatus, Dipodascus albidus, Dipodascus armillariae, Dipodascus australiensis, Dipodascus geniculatus, and Dipodascus macrosporus. The systematic discussion of the species includes synonyms, growth in malt extract, growth on 4\% extract/0.5\% yeast extract agar, growth radius on glucose-yeast extract-peptone agar, fermentation, formation of ascospores, CoQ, Mol\% G + C, gene sequence accession numbers, type strain, cell carbohydrates, origin of the strains studied, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

By performing a genome-wide study of the evolutionary dynamics in yeast promoters, we provide a first global view of the network of selection forces in the evolution of transcription factor binding sites. This analysis gives rise to new models for binding site activity, identifies families of related binding sites, and characterizes the functional similarities among them. We discovered rich and highly optimized selective pressures operating inside and around these families. In several cases, this organization reveals that a single transcription factor has multiple functional modes. We demonstrate how such functional heterogeneity is related to the binding site's affinity and how it is exploited in transcription programs.},

Divergence from H3 raises the possibility that CENP-A generates unique chromatin features to mark physically centromere location. Here we report the crystal structure of a subnucleosomal heterotetramer, human (CENP-A-H4)(2), that reveals three distinguishing properties encoded by the residues that comprise the CENP-A targeting domain (CATD; ref. 2): (1) a CENP-A-CENP-A interface that is substantially rotated relative to the H3-H3 interface; (2) a protruding loop L1 of the opposite charge as that on H3; and (3) strong hydrophobic contacts that rigidify the CENP-A-H4 interface. Residues involved in the CENP-A-CENP-A rotation are required for efficient incorporation into centromeric chromatin, indicating specificity for an unconventional nucleosome shape. DNA topological analysis indicates that CENP-A-containing nucleosomes are octameric with conventional left-handed DNA wrapping, in contrast to other recent proposals. Our results indicate that CENP-A marks centromere location by restructuring the nucleosome from within its folded histone core.},

This chapter studies the genus Kriegeria. In asexual reproduction yeast cells are elongate and budding is predominantly polar. Buds frequently develop close to the base of the parent cell and elongate parallel to the parent cell. In sexual reproduction it is seen that Kriegeria is phytoparasitic and the sexual state develops only in the host plant. The parasite develops internally in Scirpus and Eriophorum leaves and produces elongate, yellow, gelatinous pustules of basidia in the abaxial leaf surface. This chapter further examines physiology, biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. The type species mentioned is Kriegeria eriophori Bresadola. The systematic discussion of the species includes synonyms and anamorphs, growth on 5\% malt extract agar, Dalmau plate culture on corn meal agar, fermentation, gene sequence accession numbers, cell carbohydrates, origin of the strains studied, type strain, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, and agriculture and food.},

	abstract = {The abundance and identity of functional variation segregating in natural populations is paramount to dissecting the molecular basis of quantitative traits as well as human genetic diseases. Genome sequencing of multiple organisms of the same species provides an efficient means of cataloging rearrangements, insertion, or deletion polymorphisms (InDels) and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). While inbreeding depression and heterosis imply that a substantial amount of polymorphism is deleterious, distinguishing deleterious from neutral polymorphism remains a significant challenge. To identify deleterious and neutral DNA sequence variation within Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we sequenced the genome of a vineyard and oak tree strain and compared them to a reference genome. Among these three strains, 6\% of the genome is variable, mostly attributable to variation in genome content that results from large InDels. Out of the 88,000 polymorphisms identified, 93\% are SNPs and a small but significant fraction can be attributed to recent interspecific introgression and ectopic gene conversion. In comparison to the reference genome, there is substantial evidence for functional variation in gene content and structure that results from large InDels, frame-shifts, and polymorphic start and stop codons. Comparison of polymorphism to divergence reveals scant evidence for positive selection but an abundance of evidence for deleterious SNPs. We estimate that 12\% of coding and 7\% of noncoding SNPs are deleterious. Based on divergence among 11 yeast species, we identified 1,666 nonsynonymous SNPs that disrupt conserved amino acids and 1,863 noncoding SNPs that disrupt conserved noncoding motifs. The deleterious coding SNPs include those known to affect quantitative traits, and a subset of the deleterious noncoding SNPs occurs in the promoters of genes that show allele-specific expression, implying that some cis-regulatory SNPs are deleterious. Our results show that the genome sequences of both closely and distantly related species provide a means of identifying deleterious polymorphisms that disrupt functionally conserved coding and noncoding sequences.},

However, little is known of the ecology and population structure of this species in nature. Here, we present a field survey of this yeast at an unprecedented scale and have performed population genetics analysis of Chinese wild isolates with different ecological and geographical origins. We also included a set of worldwide isolates that represent the maximum genetic variation of S.~cerevisiae documented so far. We clearly show that S.~cerevisiae is a ubiquitous species in nature, occurring in highly diversified substrates from human-associated environments as well as habitats remote from human activity. Chinese isolates of S.~cerevisiae exhibited strong population structure with nearly double the combined genetic variation of isolates from the rest of the world. We identified eight new distinct wild lineages (CHN I{\textendash}VIII) from a set of 99 characterized Chinese isolates. Isolates from primeval forests occur in ancient and significantly diverged basal lineages, while those from human-associated environments generally cluster in less differentiated domestic or mosaic groups. Basal lineages from primeval forests are usually inbred, exhibit lineage-specific karyotypes and are partially reproductively isolated. Our results suggest that greatly diverged populations of wild S.~cerevisiae exist independently of and predate domesticated isolates. We find that China harbours a reservoir of natural genetic variation of S.~cerevisiae and perhaps gives an indication of the origin of the species.},

Most mutation scanning methods use PCR as a first step, but the subsequent analyses are usually qualitative rather than quantitative. Gene dosage methods based on PCR need to be quantitative (i.e., they should report molar quantities of starting material) or semi-quantitative (i.e., they should report gene dosage relative to an internal standard). Without some sort of quantitation, heterozygous deletions and duplications may be overlooked and therefore be under-ascertained. Gene dosage methods provide the additional benefit of reporting allele drop-out in the PCR. This could impact on SNP surveys, where large-scale genotyping may miss null alleles. Here we review recent developments in techniques for the detection of this type of mutation and compare their relative strengths and weaknesses.

Host plant family has the strongest effect on the phylogenetic community composition of fungi, whereas temperature and precipitation mostly affect EcM fungal richness that peaks in the temperate and boreal forest biomes, contrasting with latitudinal patterns of macro-organisms. Tropical ecosystems experience rapid turnover of organic material and have weak soil stratification, suggesting that poor habitat conditions may contribute to the relatively low richness of EcM fungi, and perhaps other soil biota, in most tropical ecosystems. For EcM fungi, greater evolutionary age and larger total area of EcM host vegetation may also contribute to the higher diversity in temperate ecosystems.

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have become an important method for mapping the genetic loci underlying complex phenotypic traits in many species. A crucial issue when performing GWAS is to control for the underlying population structure because not doing so can lead to spurious associations. Population structure is a particularly important issue in nonhuman species since it is often difficult to control for population structure during the study design phase, requiring population structure to be corrected statistically after the data have been collected. It has not yet been established if GWAS is a feasible approach in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, an important model organism and agricultural species. We thus performed an empirical study of statistical methods for controlling for population structure in GWAS using a set of 201 phenotypic traits measured in multiple resequenced strains of S. cerevisiae. We complemented our analysis of real data with an extensive set of simulations. Our main result is that a mixed linear model using the local ancestry of the strain as a covariate is effective at controlling for population structure, consistent with the mosaic structure of many S. cerevisiae strains. We further studied the evolutionary forces acting on the GWAS SNPs and found that SNPs associated with variation in phenotypic traits are enriched for low minor allele frequencies, consistent with the action of negative selection on these SNPs. Despite the effectiveness of local ancestry correction, GWAS remains challenging in highly structured populations, such as S. cerevisiae. Nonetheless, we found that, even after correcting for population structure, there is still sufficient statistical power to recover biologically meaningful associations.},

They have a haploid genome size of [{\textasciitilde}]400 million bp (Mb), which is almost eight times smaller than the human genome. Given that spiny pufferfish from the sister family Diodontidae and a fish from the outgroup Molidae have genomes twice as large as smooth puffers, it appears that the genome size of smooth puffers has contracted in the last 50-70 million years since their divergence from the spiny puffers. Here we use renaturation kinetics to compare the repetitive nature of the smooth and spiny puffer genomes. We also estimate the rates of small ({\textless}400 bp) insertions and deletions in smooth and spiny puffers using defunct non-LTR retrotransposons. We find a significantly greater abundance of a transposon-like repetitive DNA class in spiny puffers relative to smooth puffers, in addition to nearly identical indel rates. We comment on the role that large insertions may play in the evolution of genome size in these two groups. [The sequence data from this study have been submitted to GenBank under accession nos.

This chapter discusses the genus Kondoa. It provides a systematic discussion of the species and concludes with comments on the genus. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. In asexual reproduction yeast cells are formed by multilateral budding. Cells are globose, ovoid, ellipsoidal, or short-cylindrical. Pseudohyphae or true hyphae may be formed. Where known, septal pores in true hyphae are {\textquotedblleft}simple{\textquotedblright} and uniperforate. Colonies on agar media are cream, pinkish-cream, or mauve, and old cultures may become more distinctly pink but never red or orange. In sexual reproduction basidiocarps are not produced and sexual structures form on agar media. In heterothallic species, cell{\textendash}cell conjugation gives rise to true hyphae with clamp connections, whereas in homothallic species single cells give rise to true hyphae with incomplete clamp connections. Teliospores are not formed. Transversely septate (i.e., auricularioid) basidia arise directly on the hyphae. Single, forcibly discharged basidiospores (i.e., ballistospores) arise at the tip of sterigmata that form on basidial cells. Basidiospores germinate by budding. Multiple basidiospores (i.e., sporidia) may also form by budding on basidia. The genus Kondoa was erected to accommodate a single taxon, K. malvinella, which was transferred from the teliospore-forming genus Rhodosporidium on the basis of pronounced differences in partial SSU and LSU rRNA sequences with R. toruloides, the type species of the latter genus.},

One niche from which these species have been isolated is oak bark. There are no reports of these species from oak in the Southern Hemisphere. We describe the recovery of both S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus from oak in New Zealand (NZ), and provide evidence for introgression between the species. Genetic inference shows that the oak S. cerevisiae are closely related to strains isolated from NZ and Australian vineyards, but that the S. paradoxus strains are very closely related to European isolates. This discovery is surprising as the current model of S. paradoxus biogeography suggests that global dispersal is rare. We test one idea to explain how members of the European S. paradoxus population might come to be in NZ: they were transported here along with acorns brought by migrants \~{}200 years ago. We show that S. paradoxus is associated with acorns and thus provide a potential mechanism for the unwitting global dispersal of S. paradoxus by humans.},

This chapter studies the genus Lachancea. In the determination of asexual reproduction, cell division is by multilateral budding on a narrow base. Cells are spherical, ovoid ellipsoidal, or elongate. Pseudohyphae may be formed, but true hyphae are not produced. In sexual reproduction it is seen that conjugation may or may not precede ascus formation. The ascospores are smooth, spherical, and may be liberated from the ascus. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that glucose is fermented vigorously. Nitrate is not assimilated, but ethylamine is utilized as sole nitrogen source. The chapter discusses the phylogenetic placement. The type of species discussed is Lachancea thermotolerans. The species accepted are Lachancea cidri, Lachancea fermentati, Lachancea kluyveri, Lachancea meyersii, Lachancea thermotolerans, and Lachancea waltii. The systematic discussion of the species includes synonyms, growth on 5\% malt extract agar, growth on the surface of liquid media, Dalmau plate culture on morphology agar, formation of ascospores, CoQ, Mol\% G + C, gene sequence accession numbers, type strain, cell carbohydrates, origin of the strains studied, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

	abstract = {Recent developments of molecular tools have revolutionized our knowledge of microbial biodiversity by allowing detailed exploration of its different facets and generating unprecedented amount of data. One key issue with such large datasets is the development of diversity measures that cope with different data outputs and allow comparison of biodiversity across different scales. Diversity has indeed three components: local ($\alpha$), regional ($\gamma$) and the overall difference between local communities ($\beta$). Current measures of microbial diversity, derived from several approaches, provide complementary but different views. They only capture the $\beta$ component of diversity, compare communities in a pairwise way, consider all species as equivalent or lack a mathematically explicit relationship among the $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ components. We propose a unified quantitative framework based on the Rao quadratic entropy, to obtain an additive decomposition of diversity ($\gamma$ = $\alpha$ + $\beta$), so the three components can be compared, and that integrate the relationship (phylogenetic or functional) among Microbial Diversity Units that compose a microbial community. We show how this framework is adapted to all types of molecular data, and we highlight crucial issues in microbial ecology that would benefit from this framework and propose ready-to-use R-functions to easily set up our approach.},

The strain is used for studies of fungal infections and quantitative genetics because of its extensive phenotypic differences to the laboratory reference strain, including growth at high temperature and deadly virulence in mouse models. Here we show that the approximately 12-Mb genome of YJM789 contains approximately 60,000 SNPs and approximately 6,000 indels with respect to the reference S288c genome, leading to protein polymorphisms with a few known cases of phenotypic changes. Several ORFs are found to be unique to YJM789, some of which might have been acquired through horizontal transfer. Localized regions of high polymorphism density are scattered over the genome, in some cases spanning multiple ORFs and in others concentrated within single genes. The sequence of YJM789 contains clues to pathogenicity and spurs the development of more powerful approaches to dissecting the genetic basis of complex hereditary traits.},

Here, we show that sympatric populations of S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus from a single natural site are phenotypically differentiated in their growth rate responses to temperature. Our main finding is that the S. cerevisiae population exhibits a markedly higher growth rate at 37{\textdegree}C than the S. paradoxus population; we also find possible differences in growth rate between these populations at two lower temperatures. We discuss the implications of our results for the coexistence of these yeasts in natural environments, and we suggest that thermal growth response may be an evolutionarily labile feature of these organisms that could be analyzed using genomic approaches.},

This chapter discusses the genus Leucosporidium. It provides a systematic discussion of the species and concludes with comments on the genus. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. In asexual reproduction the yeast stage reproduces by budding. Cells are ovoid, ellipsoid, or elongate. Pseudohyphae or true hyphae may be present. Ballistoconidia are not formed. Growth on solid media is white to cream colored and often mucoid. Visible carotenoid pigments are not present. In sexual reproduction hyphae have clamp connections and form globose teliospores. Teliospores germinate to produce transversely septate basidia. Ovoid to bacilliform basidiospores are passively released and germinate by budding. Hyphal septa have {\textquotedblleft}simple{\textquotedblright} septal pores, i.e., central pores with the cell wall attenuating. Colacosomes (i.e., lenticular bodies) are present. The genus Leucosporidium might be viewed as psychrotolerant as, apart from a few strains of L. scottii that grow at 30{\textdegree}C, all the other species are unable to grow at this temperature. The species that are more dependent on low temperatures are L. antarcticum, which is unable to grow at 18{\textdegree}C, and L. fasciculatum, which is unable to grow at 22{\textdegree}C.},

Do geographically separated populations of micro-organisms diverge independently, or does their structure fit the often quoted Bass-Becking description 'everything is everywhere; the environment selects'? Aided by high-resolution genetic and genomic tools, the search for 'microbial marsupials' has revealed that in fact both are true; some species of micro-organisms demonstrate allopatric divergence, while others do not. This discovery opens the door for comparative analyses, where questions about the differences in evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that drive divergence and speciation in different microbial species can begin to be explored. Investigating these differences in evolutionary mechanisms will greatly enhance interest in, and understanding of, the dynamic processes that create and maintain the vast diversity of the microbial world.},

Using long-term mutation-accumulation lines of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, we estimate the rate and magnitude of mutational effects for a suite of behaviors characterizing individual chemosensory responses to a repellant stimulus. In accordance with evidence that the vast majority of mutations are deleterious, we find that behavioral responses degrade over time as a result of spontaneous mutation accumulation. The rate of mutation for behavioral traits is roughly of the same order or slightly smaller than those previously estimated for reproductive traits and the average size of the mutational effects is also comparable. These results have important implications for the maintenance of genetic variation for behavior in natural populations as well as for expectations for behavioral change within endangered species and captive populations.},

Here, recently established databases on de novo mutations for monogenic disorders are used to estimate the rate and molecular spectrum of spontaneously arising mutations and to derive a number of inferences with respect to eukaryotic genome evolution. Although the human per-generation mutation rate is exceptionally high, on a per-cell division basis, the human germline mutation rate is lower than that recorded for any other species. Comparison with data from other species demonstrates a universal mutational bias toward A/T composition, and leads to the hypothesis that genome-wide nucleotide composition generally evolves to the point at which the power of selection in favor of G/C is approximately balanced by the power of random genetic drift, such that variation in equilibrium genome-wide nucleotide composition is largely defined by variation in mutation biases. Quantification of the hazards associated with introns reveals that mutations at key splice-site residues are a major source of human mortality. Finally, a consideration of the long-term consequences of current human behavior for deleterious-mutation accumulation leads to the conclusion that a substantial reduction in human fitness can be expected over the next few centuries in industrialized societies unless novel means of genetic intervention are developed.},

This chapter aims to present an overview of yeast cell biology, biochemical structure and composition of cell walls in various yeast species, septal pore ultrastructure, and other subcellular characteristics, and a phylogenetic framework to these observations. Yeast cells have ultrastructural features typical of other eukaryotic cells, which include the presence of membrane-bound organelles. Through the use of microscopic techniques, yeast cells have been the topic of detailed structural research for many decades. Because of their relatively small size, electron microscopy is an essential tool for the study of the cellular ultrastructure of the cell. Yeast cells contain all subcellular structures typical of eukaryotes. These structures include the cytoskeleton, a nucleus and various subcellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), the Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and microbodies. Like plants, yeast cells contain a vacuole, and the plasma membrane is surrounded by a rigid cell wall. However, chloroplasts are absent in all fungi, which include the yeasts. Fluorescence microscopy methods have become an attractive tool for studying living yeast cells due to the availability of novel fluorescent dyes and the introduction of genes that encode fluorescent proteins. Upon introduction of hybrid genes encoding a fluorescent protein fused to a yeast protein, any subcellular structure can be specifically marked and its kinetics analyzed in real time in living yeast cells.},

The geographic distribution of haplotypes reflects human history, with a loss of haplotype diversity as distance increases from Africa. Although the extent of linkage disequilibrium (LD) varies markedly across populations, considerable sharing of haplotype structure exists, and inferred recombination hotspot locations generally match across groups. The four samples in the International HapMap Project contain the majority of common haplotypes found in most populations: averaging across populations, 83\% of common 20-kb haplotypes in a population are also common in the most similar HapMap sample. Consequently, although the portability of tag SNPs based on the HapMap is reduced in low-LD Africans, the HapMap will be helpful for the design of genome-wide association mapping studies in nearly all human populations.},

However, information on pelagic-benthic coupling, diagenesis, and processes controlling nucleic acid preservation in deep-sea sediments is practically nonexistent. In this study, we compared nucleic acid fluxes, sedimentary DNA and RNA concentrations, and the enzymatically hydrolyzable fraction of DNA in a bathyal continental margin (North Aegean Sea) and an open-sea system (South Aegean Sea) of the Eastern Mediterranean. The two systems displayed contrasting patterns of nucleic acid fluxes, which increased significantly with depth in the North Aegean Sea and decreased with depth in the South Aegean Sea. These results suggest that in continental margin and open-ocean systems different processes control the nucleic acid supply to the sea floor. Differences in nucleic acid fluxes were reflected by nucleic acid concentrations in the sediments, which reached extremely high values in the North Aegean Sea. In this system, a large fraction of DNA may be buried, as suggested by the large fraction of DNA resistant to nuclease degradation and by estimates of burial efficiency (ca. eight times higher in the North than in the South Aegean Sea). Overall, the results reported here suggest that the preservation of DNA in deeper sediment layers may be favored in benthic systems characterized by high sedimentation rates.},

	abstract = {Nucleosomes exert a repressive influence on the biological functions of DNA by restricting the access of proteins to DNA. To investigate how intrinsic properties of nucleosomes modulate DNA-accessibility in vivo, we studied DNA repair by photolyase in the yeast URA3 gene. Formation of DNA lesions (cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, CPDs) and photolyase activity are controlled precisely by light. Preceding work revealed that photolyase repairs nucleosome-free DNA rapidly, while repair of nucleosomes is inhibited severely. The high-resolution data presented here show slow repair in the center of nucleosomes and a gradual increase towards the periphery. This pattern was observed in all nucleosomes and demonstrates that dynamic properties facilitate DNA accessibility. Since the URA3 nucleosomes can occupy alternate positions, the repair data are most consistent with nucleosome mobility that moves CPDs in linker DNA where they are repaired rapidly. A partial and transient unfolding or disruption of nucleosomes, however, may not be excluded. In addition, repair heterogeneity was found between closely spaced sites, indicating that structural properties of nucleosomes contribute to damage processing. Moreover, nucleosome-specific modulation of photolyase was found on the transcribed and non-transcribed strand. This is in contrast to homogeneous repair of the transcribed strand by nucleotide excision repair, and reveals fundamental differences in how both repair systems interact with nucleosomes and transcription.},

This chapter discusses the genus Filobasidium. It provides a systematic discussion of the species and concludes with comments on the genus. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. In asexual reproduction reproduction occurs by budding. Cells are globose, ovoid, ellipsoid, or elongated. Pseudohyphae and true hyphae may be produced. Colonies are white, grayish-white, cream colored, or slightly pinkish and usually mucoid. In sexual reproduction hyphae with lateral or terminal holobasidia are produced following mating in heterothallic species such as F.floriforme, F.capsuligenum, and F.uniguttulatum. Although sexual patterns have not been defined in the remaining species of Filobasidium, general sexual features are similar to heterothallic species of the genus. Basidiocarps are absent. Sessile basidiospores are produced terminally on the apex of the holobasidiumina petal-like whorl, giving the basidium a flower-like appearance from an apical view. Clamp connections are present at septa, which contain dolipores with or without parenthesomes. Physiologically, F.capsuligenum differs from the other members of the genus by the ability to ferment glucose and maltose. Ultrastructurally, F.capsuligenum differs from F.floriforme by having cone-shaped vesicular parenthesomes, while the latter species seems to lack this typical parenthesome structure but has poorly preserved vesicles present near the dolipore.},

This chapter discusses the genus Bulleromyces. It provides a systematic discussion of the species and concludes with comments on the genus. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. In asexual reproduction yeast cells are ellipsoid, subglobose, or cylindric and monokaryotic. Budding is polar, with buds emerging enteroblastically, sessile, or on short denticles and with percurrent or sympodial proliferation. Ballistoconidia are rotationally symmetrical and subglobose. Colonies are cream, smooth, butyrous, or mucoid. In sexual reproduction the teleomorphic state may be heterothallic or self-sporulating. Basidiocarps are absent. Dikaryotic hyphae are regularly branched and septate, with clamp connections and haustorial branches. Hyphal septa have dolipores with cupulate (namely, Tremellales type) parenthesomes. Basidia are subglobose, clavate, or ovoid and after karyogamy become longitudinally, obliquely, or transversely septate with two to four cells. Germination of basidia occurs by yeast cells or hyphae on which yeast cells or ballistospores originate. Three teleomorphic genera are presently known for the anamorphic genus Bullera, namely Bulleromyces, Bulleribasidium, and Auriculibuller.},

	abstract = {Few studies of global diversity gradients in plants exist, largely because the data are not available for all species involved. Instead, most global studies have focussed on vertebrates, as these taxa have historically been associated with the most complete data. Here, we address this shortfall by first investigating global diversity gradients in monocots, a morphologically and functionally diverse clade representing a quarter of flowering plant diversity, and then assessing congruence between monocot and vertebrate diversity patterns. To do this, we create a new dataset that merges biome-level associations for all monocot genera with country-level associations for almost all \~{}70,000 species. We then assess the evidence for direct versus indirect effects of this plant diversity on vertebrate diversity using a combination of linear regression and structural equation modelling (SEM). Finally, we also calculate overlap of diversity hotspots for monocots and each vertebrate taxon. Monocots follow a latitudinal gradient although with pockets of extra-tropical diversity, mirroring patterns in vertebrates. Monocot diversity is positively associated with vertebrate diversity, but the strength of correlation varies depending on the clades being compared. Monocot diversity explains marginal amounts of variance ({\textless}10\%) after environmental factors have been accounted for. However, correlations remain among model residuals, and SEMs apparently reveal some direct effects of monocot richness. Our results suggest that collinear responses to environmental gradients are behind much of the congruence observed, but that there is some evidence for direct effects of producer diversity on consumer diversity. Much remains to be done before broad-scale diversity gradients among taxa are fully explained. Our dataset of monocot distributions will aid in this endeavour.},

We present LAGAN, a system for rapid global alignment of two homologous genomic sequences, and Multi-LAGAN, a system for multiple global alignment of genomic sequences. We tested our systems on a data set consisting of greater than 12 Mb of high-quality sequence from 12 vertebrate species. All the sequence was derived from the genomic region orthologous to an [{\textasciitilde}]1.5-Mb region on human chromosome 7q31.3. We found that both LAGAN and Multi-LAGAN compare favorably with other leading alignment methods in correctly aligning protein-coding exons, especially between distant homologs such as human and chicken, or human and fugu. Multi-LAGAN produced the most accurate alignments, while requiring just 75 minutes on a personal computer to obtain the multiple alignment of all 12 sequences. Multi-LAGAN is a practical method for generating multiple alignments of long genomic sequences at any evolutionary distance. Our systems are publicly available at http://lagan.stanford.edu.},

One to four, or many, ascospores are formed per ascus. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Vanderwaltozyma polyspora. The genus is particularly important in terms of nomenclature, as it contains the former type species of Kluyveromyces, Vanderwaltozyma polyspora.

	abstract = {Author Summary In eukaryotic cells, the majority of DNA is packaged in nucleosomes comprised of \~{}147 bp of DNA wound tightly around the highly conserved histone octamer. Nucleosomal DNA from diverse organisms shows an anti-correlated \~{}10 bp periodicity of AT-rich and GC-rich dinucleotides. These sequence features influence DNA bending and shape, facilitating structural interactions. We asked whether natural selection mediated through the periodic sequence preferences of nucleosomes shapes the evolution of non-protein-coding regions of D. melanogaster by examining the inter- and intra-species genomic variation relative to these fundamental chromatin building blocks. The sequence changes across nucleosome-bound regions on the melanogaster lineage mirror the observed nucleosome dinucleotide periodicities. Importantly, we show that the frequencies of polymorphisms in natural populations vary across these regions, paralleling divergence, with higher frequencies of preferred alleles. These patterns are most evident for intronic regions and indicate that non-protein coding regions are evolving toward sequences that facilitate the canonical association with the histone core. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that interactions between DNA and the core have systematic impacts on function that are subject to natural selection and are not solely due to mutational bias. These ubiquitous interactions with the histone core partially account for the evolutionary constraint observed in unannotated genomic regions, and may drive broad changes in base composition.},

This chapter studies the genus Eremothecium. In the determination of asexual reproduction, budding cells are absent or present, and when present, budding is multilateral on a narrow base. Cells are globose, ovoid, ellipsoidal, or cylindrical. Enteroarthric conidia are infrequently produced by one species. Pseudohyphae and true hyphae are generally present. Colonies are smooth or floccose and white, grayish, or yellow in color. In sexual reproduction it is seen that asci, which become deliquescent, form 8{\textendash}32 ascospores that are fusiform or acicular. Ascospores may have a central septum, and those of some species have a tapered, terminal extension of the cell wall. Species appear to be homothallic. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that sugars are fermented by some species. Nitrate is not assimilated. Coenzyme Q may have five, six, seven, eight, or nine isoprene units in the side chain, some of which are present in minor proportions. The chapter further examines the phylogenetic placement. The type of species mentioned is Eremothecium cymbalariae. The species accepted are Eremothecium ashbyi, Eremothecium coryli, Eremothecium cymbalariae, Eremothecium gossypii, and Eremothecium sinecaudum. The systematic discussion of the species includes synonyms, growth on 4\% malt extract/0.5\% yeast extract agar, growth on the surface of assimilation media, formation of ascospores, origin of the strains studied, authentic strain, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

It is often the case that thousands of features in a genomewide data set are tested against some null hypothesis, where a number of features are expected to be significant. Here we propose an approach to measuring statistical  significance in these genomewide studies based on the concept of the false discovery rate. This approach offers a sensible balance between the number of true and false positives that is automatically calibrated and easily interpreted. In doing so, a measure of statistical significance called the q value is associated with each tested feature. The q value is similar to the well known p value, except it is a measure of significance in terms of the false discovery rate rather than the false  positive rate. Our approach avoids a flood of false positive results, while offering a more liberal criterion than what has been used in genome scans for linkage.},

	abstract = {Most explanations for the evolutionary maintenance of sex depend on the assumption that sex produces variation by recombining parental haplotypes in the offspring. Therefore, meiosis is expected to be useful only in heterozygotes. We tested this assumption by competing sexual strains of yeast against constitutive asexuals in a hot (37 degrees C) culture for 500 generations, in either heterozygous or homozygous genetic backgrounds. We found that there was an initial cost of sex for all the sexual strains, which was indicated by a sharp increase in the proportion of asexuals after the induction of sex. The cost was larger in the heterozygotes than in the homozygotes, probably because of recombinational load. However, in two of the three heterozygote backgrounds, after the initial success of the asexuals, the remaining sexuals eventually drove them out of the population. These two heterozygotes also suffered the largest initial cost of sex. In the other heterozygote and in the three homozygote backgrounds it appeared to be a matter of chance whether sexuals or asexuals won. The average relative fitness increased in all the strains, but the increase was largest in the two strains that showed both the clearest advantage and the largest cost of sex. We conclude that these results are consistent with the traditional view that sex has a short-term cost but a long-term benefit.},

We have identified putative centromeric regions, orthologous to the centromeres, in each of the eight chromosomes by bioinformatic analysis.

As in , the CdCse4p-associated core centromeric regions are 3{\quotesinglbase}{\"A}{\`i}5 kb in length and show no sequence similarity to one another.

However, the location of the centromere and the relative position of Cse4p-rich centromeric chromatin in the orthologous regions with respect to adjacent ORFs are conserved in both species, suggesting that centromere identity is not solely determined by DNA sequence. Unlike known point and regional centromeres of other organisms, centromeres in and have no common centromere-specific sequence motifs or repeats except some of the chromosome-specific pericentric repeats that are found to be similar in these two species.

However, those labs may not have easy access to, and familiarity with, computational tools to analyze those data.
RESULTS: We have created a suite of tools for the Galaxy web server aimed at handling nucleotide and amino-acid polymorphisms discovered by full-genome sequencing of several individuals of the same species, or using a SNP genotyping microarray. In addition to providing user-friendly tools, a main goal is to make published analyses reproducible. While most of the examples discussed in this paper deal with nuclear-genome diversity in non-human vertebrates, we also illustrate the application of the tools to fungal genomes, human biomedical data, and mitochondrial sequences.
CONCLUSIONS: This project illustrates that a small group can design, implement, test, document, and distribute a Galaxy tool collection to meet the needs of a particular community of biologists.},

This chapter studies the genus Saprochaete. In the asexual reproduction it is seen that thallus growth is initially mostly pseudohyphal with inflated cells. Hyphae are branched at acute angles with acuminate apices and disarticulate into arthroconidia. Additional sympodial and annellidic blastoconidiogenesis may be present. Chlamydospores are mostly absent. Septa have micropores. In sexual reproduction it is found that Magnusiomyces represents the teleomorph state of Saprochaete. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which assimilation of D-xylose is mostly absent, nitrate is not assimilated, urease activity is absent, and extracellular starch is not produced. The diazonium blue B reaction is negative and small subunit rRNA genes have deletions in domains V2, V3, and V8. The type species taken is Saprochaete saccharophila. Several Saprochaete species produce remarkably large, somewhat alga-like thalli, which are strictly hyphal and do not produce budding cells. Most species have only rarely been isolated, and thus it is difficult to establish any ecological trends in each species.},

We report here a genomewide approach for fractionating yeast chromatin into two functionally distinct parts, one containing RNA polymerase II transcribed sequences, and the other comprising noncoding sequences and genes transcribed by RNA polymerases I and III. Noncoding regions could be further fractionated into promoters and segments lacking promoters. The observed separations were apparently based on differential crosslinking efficiency of chromatin in different genomic regions. The results reveal a genomewide molecular mechanism for marking promoters and genomic regions that have a license to be transcribed by RNA polymerase II, a previously unrecognized level of genomic complexity that may exist in all eukaryotes. Our approach has broad potential use as a tool for genome annotation and for the characterization of global changes in chromatin structure that accompany different genetic, environmental, and disease  states.},

	abstract = {In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, replicators can function outside the chromosome as autonomously replicating sequence (ARS) elements; however, within chromosome III, certain ARSs near the transcriptionally silent HML locus show no replication origin activity. Two of these ARSs comprise the transcriptional silencers E (ARS301) and I (ARS302). Another, ARS303, resides between HML and the CHA1 gene, and its function is not known. Here we further localized and characterized ARS303 and in the process discovered a new ARS, ARS320. Both ARS303 and ARS320 are competent as chromosomal replication origins since origin activity was seen when they were inserted at a different position in chromosome III. However, at their native locations, where the two ARSs are in a cluster with ARS302, the I silencer, no replication origin activity was detected regardless of yeast mating type, special growth conditions that induce the transcriptionally repressed CHA1 gene, trans-acting mutations that abrogate transcriptional silencing at HML (sir3, orc5), or cis-acting mutations that delete the E and I silencers containing ARS elements. These results suggest that, for the HML ARS cluster (ARS303, ARS320, and ARS302), inactivity of origins is independent of local transcriptional silencing, even though origins and silencers share key cis- and trans-acting components. Surprisingly, deletion of active replication origins located 25 kb (ORI305) and 59 kb (ORI306) away led to detection of replication origin function at the HML ARS cluster, as well as at ARS301, the E silencer. Thus, replication origin silencing at HML ARSs is mediated by active replication origins residing at long distances from HML in the chromosome. The distal active origins are known to fire early in S phase, and we propose that their inactivation delays replication fork arrival at HML, providing additional time for HML ARSs to fire as origins.},

This chapter discusses the genus Trimorphomyce.

Basidiospore germination yields a budding yeast stage. In the sexual reproduction it is found that small watery-gelatinous sporocarps develop on the hyphae and conidial masses of Arthrinium-like anamorphon coarse grasses, bamboos, and Sasa spp. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Trimorphomyces papilionaceus.

When in silico predictions of 4154 growth phenotypes were compared to two published large-scale gene deletion studies, an 83\% agreement was found between iND750's predictions and the experimental studies. Analysis of the failure modes showed that false predictions were primarily caused by iND750's limited inclusion of cellular processes outside of metabolism.

This chapter studies the genus Brettanomyces. In the asexual reproduction it is seen that this reproduction is either by multilateral budding or, rarely, by bipolar budding in basipetal succession on a narrow base. Cells are spherical, subglobose to ellipsoidal, frequently ogival, or cylindrical to elongate. Pseudohyphae are simple or well- developed and branched. One-celled, nonseptate filaments may be formed. In sexual reproduction the ascosporic species are assigned to the teleomorphic genus Dekkera. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus, which shows that the cultures grow slowly and are usually short-lived. Acetic acid is produced aerobically from glucose. Fermentation is usually stimulated by molecular oxygen (Crabtree effect). Thiamine and biotin are required as extraneous vitamins. Coenzyme Q-9 is present and the diazonium blue B reaction is negative. The type species taken is Brettanomyces bruxellensis. The production of intracellular oxidases, nitrite, and nitrate reductases in Brettanomyces and Dekkera are discussed in the chapter and the relationship between the two genera is explained.},

This chapter studies the genus Botryozyma. In the asexual reproduction budding is holoblastic and multilateral and occurs near the apices of the cell. Cells are cylindrical to short-ovoid. Two or more branches develop at the apex of the ovoid terminal cell and serve as attachment cells on a suitable substrate. Thalli or pseudohyphae are formed, depending on culture conditions and age. In recently isolated cultures maintained on agar media, thallus formation is relatively uniform and thallus growth is determinate. Young thalli are typically composed of three cells: an ovoid terminal attachment cell with branches formed from the tapered end, and two cylindrical cells formed in apical succession. Approximately three to five cells develop from the apical region of each thallus cell, and additional cells form from the apical regions in no apparent order. After the development of two or more thallus cells in a successive row, a terminal anchoring cell typically develops from the apical region of the end cell. The apex of the anchoring cell appears slightly knob-like prior to differentiating into two or more branches. At the onset of differentiation, the new thallus disarticulates from the parent thallus, resulting in a new thallus. Several thalli may form from the parent thallus at the same time. Cultures that are serially transferred over a long period may no longer show the morphological features. In sexual reproduction it is found that the Ascobotryozyma represents the ascosporic state of Botryozyma. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus.

If deleterious mutations interact synergistically, the mutational deterministic hypothesis predicts that a high genomic deleterious mutation rate (U) will offset the reproductive disadvantage of outcrossing relative to asexual or selfing reproduction. Therefore, C. elegans and C. briggsae (both largely selfing) should both exhibit lower rates of deleterious mutation than the obligately outcrossing relative C. remanei. Using a comparative approach, we estimate U to be equivalent (and {\textless}1) among all three related species. Stochastic mutational models, Muller's ratchet and Hill{\textendash}Robertson interference, are expected to cause reductions in the effective population size in species that rarely outcross, thereby allowing deleterious mutations to accumulate at an elevated rate. We find only limited support for more rapid molecular evolution in selfing lineages. Overall, our analyses indicate that the evolution of breeding system in this group is unlikely to be explained solely by available mutational models.},

	abstract = {Next generation DNA sequencing (NGS) approaches are rapidly surpassing Sanger sequencing for characterizing the diversity of natural microbial communities. Despite this rapid transition, few comparisons exist between Sanger sequences and the generally much shorter reads of NGS. Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) derived from full-length (Sanger sequencing) and pyrotag (454 sequencing of the V9 hypervariable region) sequences of 18S rRNA gene from ten global samples were analyzed in order to compare the resulting protistan community structure and species richness. Pyrotag OTUs called at 98\% sequence similarity yielded similar overall numbers of OTUs as full-length sequences when the latter were called at 97\% similarity. Singleton OTUs strongly influenced estimates of species richness but not higher-level taxonomic composition of the community. The pyrotag and full-length sequence dataset had slightly different taxonomic composition of rhizarians, stramenopiles, cryptophytes, and haptophytes, but both datasets had similarly high composition of alveolates. Pyrotag OTUs with the most pyrotag sequences were comprised of pyrotags that mapped at 100\% similarity to multiple full-length OTUs. Thus, pyrotags sequenced from a single hypervariable region might not be appropriate for establishing protistan species-level OTUs. However, nonmetric multidimensional scaling plots constructed with the two datasets yielded similar clusters, indicating that beta diversity analysis results were similar for both Sanger and NGS sequences. Short pyrotag sequences can provide holistic assessments of protistan communities, although care must be taken when interpreting the results. Longer reads ({\textgreater} 500 bp) now becoming available through NGS should provide powerful tools for assessing the diversity of microbial eukaryotic assemblages.},

Instead, ecologists and evolutionary biologists are focusing on close relatives of S. cerevisiae, the seven species in the genus Saccharomyces. The best-studied Saccharomyces yeast, after S. cerevisiae, is S. paradoxus, an oak tree resident throughout the northern hemisphere. In addition, several more members of the genus Saccharomyces have recently been discovered. Some Saccharomyces species are only found in nature, while others include both wild and domesticated strains. Comparisons between domesticated and wild yeasts have pinpointed hybridization, introgression and high phenotypic diversity as signatures of domestication. But studies of wild Saccharomyces natural history, biogeography and ecology are only beginning. Much remains to be understood about wild yeasts' ecological interactions and life cycles in nature. We encourage researchers to continue to investigate Saccharomyces yeasts in nature, both to place S. cerevisiae biology into its ecological context and to develop the genus Saccharomyces as a model clade for ecology and evolution. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

We recently found sympatric pairs of Saccharomyces species, composed of one cryotolerant and one thermotolerant species in oak bark samples of various geographic origins. In order to contribute to explain the occurrence in sympatry of Saccharomyces species, we screened Saccharomyces genomic data for protein divergence that might be correlated to distinct growth temperature preferences of the species, using the dN/dS ratio as a measure of protein evolution rates and pair-wise species comparisons. In addition to proteins previously implicated in growth at suboptimal temperatures, we found that glycolytic enzymes were among the proteins exhibiting higher than expected divergence when one cryotolerant and one thermotolerant species are compared. By measuring glycolytic fluxes and glycolytic enzymatic activities in different species and at different temperatures, we subsequently show that the unusual divergence of glycolytic genes may be related to divergent evolution of the glycolytic pathway aligning its performance to the growth temperature profiles of the different species. In general, our results support the view that growth temperature preference is a trait that may have undergone divergent selection in the course of ecological speciation in Saccharomyces.},

The genetic diversity contained in the global population of yeast strains represents a valuable resource for a number of fields, including genetics, bioengineering, and studies of evolution and population structure. Here, we apply a multiplexed, reduced genome sequencing strategy (restriction site-associated sequencing or RAD-seq) to genotype a large collection of S. cerevisiae strains isolated from a wide range of geographical locations and environmental niches. The method permits the sequencing of the same 1\% of all genomes, producing a multiple sequence alignment of 116,880 bases across 262 strains. We find diversity among these strains is principally organized by geography, with European, North American, Asian, and African/S. E. Asian populations defining the major axes of genetic variation. At a finer scale, small groups of strains from cacao, olives, and sake are defined by unique variants not present in other strains. One population, containing strains from a variety of fermentations, exhibits high levels of heterozygosity and a mixture of alleles from European and Asian populations, indicating an admixed origin for this group. We propose a model of geographic differentiation followed by human-associated admixture, primarily between European and Asian populations and more recently between European and North American populations. The large collection of genotyped yeast strains characterized here will provide a useful resource for the broad community of yeast researchers.},

Because realistic sample sizes are far smaller than the total population, it is impractical to exhaustively characterize diversity of most populations. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of calculating the genetic diversity of a spatial population from a sample using genealogical models. We trace the history of a population by simulating the locations of the ancestors of a particular sample of the population backwards in time. We use this method to estimate the genetic diversity of the global population of Pseudomonas bacteria. The same results are obtained whether using a global sample or a subsample restricted to a particular geographic region (California). The results are also validated by comparing additional predictions of the model to the data. Furthermore, we use these results to show that the level of genetic diversity in a population depends strongly on the size of its habitat, much more strongly than does biodiversity as measured by the number of species. The strong dependence of diversity on habitat area has significant implications for conservation strategies.},

	abstract = {Darwin's finches comprise a group of 15 species endemic to the Galapagos (14 species) and Cocos (1 species) Islands in the Pacific Ocean. The group is monophyletic and originated from an ancestral species that reached the Galapagos Archipelago from Central or South America. Descendants of this ancestor on the Archipelago then colonized Cocos Island. In the present study, we used sequences of two mitochondrial (mt) DNA segments (922 bp of the cytochrome b gene and 1,082 bp of the control region), as well as two nuclear markers (830 bp of numt2, consisting of 140 bp of mtDNA control region and 690 bp of flanking nuclear DNA; and 740 bp of numt3, consisting of 420 bp of mt cytochrome b sequence flanked by 320 bp of nuclear DNA) to identify the species group most closely related to the Darwin's finches. To this end, we analyzed the sequences of 28 species representing the main groups (tribes) of the family Fringillidae, as well as 2 outgroup species and 13 species of Darwin's finches. In addition, we used mtDNA cytochrome b sequences of some 180 additional Fringillidae species from the database for phylogeny reconstruction by maximum-parsimony, maximum-likelihood, minimum-evolution, and neighbor-joining methods. The study identifies the grassquit genus Tiaris, and specifically the species Tiaris obscura, as the nearest living relative of Darwin's finches among the species surveyed. Darwin's finches diverged from the Tiaris group shortly after the various extant species of Tiaris diverged from one another. The initial adaptive radiation of the Tiaris group apparently occurred on the Caribbean islands and then spread to Central and South America, from where the ancestors of Darwin's finches departed for the Galapagos Islands approximately 2.3 MYA, at the time of the dramatic climatic changes associated with the closure of the Panamanian isthmus and the onset of Pleistocene glaciation.},

We observed a distinctive approximately 200-base pair (bp) periodic pattern of genetic variation downstream of transcription start sites; the rate of insertions and deletions longer than 1 bp peaked at positions of approximately +200, +400, and +600 bp, whereas the point mutation rate showed corresponding valleys. This approximately 200-bp periodicity was correlated with the chromatin structure, with nucleosome occupancy minimized at positions 0, +200, +400, and +600 bp.

This chapter studies the genus Wickerhamomyces. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that budding is multilateral on a narrow base. Cells are spherical, ovoid, or elongate. Pseudohyphae and true hyphae are produced by some species. In sexual reproduction it is found that the asci may be unconjugated or show conjugation between a cell and its bud or between independent cells. Some species are heterothallic. Asci may be persistent or deliquescent and form one to four ascospores that may be hat-shaped or spherical with an equatorial ledge. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Wickerhamomyces canadensis. The genus Pichia, from which species of Wickerhamomyces were transferred, was determined to be highly polyphyletic from analysis.},

We concentrate here on five species of Saccharomycetaceae, a large subdivision of hemiascomycetes, that we call {\textquotedblleft}protoploid{\textquotedblright} because they diverged from the S. cerevisiae lineage prior to its genome duplication. We determined the complete genome sequences of three of these species: Kluyveromyces (Lachancea) thermotolerans and Saccharomyces (Lachancea) kluyveri (two members of the newly described Lachancea clade), and Zygosaccharomyces rouxii. We included in our comparisons the previously available sequences of Kluyveromyces lactis and Ashbya (Eremothecium) gossypii. Despite their broad evolutionary range and significant individual variations in each lineage, the five protoploid Saccharomycetaceae share a core repertoire of approximately 3300 protein families and a high degree of conserved synteny. Synteny blocks were used to define gene orthology and to infer ancestors. Far from representing minimal genomes without redundancy, the five protoploid yeasts contain numerous copies of paralogous genes, either dispersed or in tandem arrays, that, altogether, constitute a third of each genome. Ancient, conserved paralogs as well as novel, lineage-specific paralogs were identified.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the genus Cuniculitrema. It provides a systematic discussion of the species. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. In asexual reproduction yeast cells are ovoid or have an irregular shape and produce one or more stalk-like conidiophores, each giving rise to a single conidium. The conidium is freed without forceful ejection at the distal end of the stalk. Ballistoconidia are not formed. Cultures are cream colored. In sexual reproduction basidiocarps are not known. Hyphae have clamp connections and haustorial branches. The sexual structures are formed in the filamentous phase. The basidia are of the Tremella type and globose, with four compartments separated by longitudinal septa. The basidiospores are passively released and germinate by budding. The septal pore is a dolipore with cupulate parenthesomes. The salient features of Cuniculitrema are the production of Tremella-type basidia, combined with the formation of stalked conidiophores, and an intermediate, probably dikaryotic, conidial stage. A Cuniculitrema-like life cycle might be hypothesized for its asexual relatives presently classified in Fellomyces and Kockovaella.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Centromeres represent the last frontiers of plant and animal genomics. Although they perform a conserved function in chromosome segregation, centromeres are typically composed of repetitive satellite sequences that are rapidly evolving. The nucleosomes of centromeres are characterized by a special H3-like histone (CenH3), which evolves rapidly and adaptively in Drosophila and Arabidopsis. Most plant, animal and fungal centromeres also bind a large protein, centromere protein C (CENP-C), that is characterized by a single 24 amino-acid motif (CENPC motif).RESULTS:Whereas we find no evidence that mammalian CenH3 (CENP-A) has been evolving adaptively, mammalian CENP-C proteins contain adaptively evolving regions that overlap with regions of DNA-binding activity. In plants we find that CENP-C proteins have complex duplicated regions, with conserved amino and carboxyl termini that are dissimilar in sequence to their counterparts in animals and fungi. Comparisons of Cenpc genes from Arabidopsis species and from grasses revealed multiple regions that are under positive selection, including duplicated exons in some grasses. In contrast to plants and animals, yeast CENP-C (Mif2p) is under negative selection.CONCLUSIONS:CENP-Cs in all plant and animal lineages examined have regions that are rapidly and adaptively evolving. To explain these remarkable evolutionary features for a single-copy gene that is needed at every mitosis, we propose that CENP-Cs, like some CenH3s, suppress meiotic drive of centromeres during female meiosis. This process can account for the rapid evolution and the complexity of centromeric DNA in plants and animals as compared to fungi.},

Sequencing of the ITS1, 5.8S and ITS2 loci allowed to assign 226 yeast strains at the species level, including 41 S.~paradoxus strains. Our intensive sampling suggests that if present, S.~cerevisiae is rare at these northern latitudes. Our sampling efforts spread across several months of the year revealed that successful sampling increases throughout the summer and diminishes significantly at the beginning of the fall. The data obtained on the ecological context of yeasts corroborate what was previously reported on Pichiaceae, Saccharomycodaceae, Debaryomycetaceae and Phaffomycetaceae yeast families. We identified 24 yeast isolates that could not be assigned to any known species and that may be of taxonomic, medical, or biotechnological importance.

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the genus Auriculibuller. It provides a systematic discussion of the species and concludes with comments on the genus. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology, and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. In asexual reproduction yeast cells are ovoid or elongate, and budding is multilateral or polar. Ballistoconidia are formed and are rotationally symmetrical. Cultures are cream colored and become darker upon aging. In sexual reproduction the sexual structures are formed in the filamentous state and the hyphae have clamp connections and form haustorial branches. The sexual state has only been observed in culture, and basidiocarps are not formed. Basidia are usually transversely septate, occasionally longitudinally septate, and arranged in small clusters or in pairs. The basidiospores are produced at the apex of tubular sterigmata and are forcibly discharged. They are globose, rotationally symmetrical, and germinate by budding or repetition. The salient features of Auriculibuller are the formation of transversely septate basidia and its phylogenetic affiliation with the Tremellales. This type of basidial formation is rare in the Tremellales as most sexual species (e.g., those classified in the genera Bulleromyces, Fibulobasidium, Tremella, or Trimorphomyces) produce basidia of the Tremella type, i.e., they have subglobose to pyriform basidia that are longitudinally or obliquely cruciate-septate.},

Functional elements have lower rates of evolution than degenerate ones, and higher conservation at functionally important sites. However, functionally important and unimportant sites are equally likely to have been involved in the evolution of new function during the domestication of VDE into HO. The domestication event also indicates that VDE has been lost in some species, and that VDE has been present in yeasts for more than 50MY.},

Using parameters from published studies of recombination in E. coli, we find that the presence of mutators has the potential to greatly enhance bacterial population adaptation when compared to populations without mutators. In one specific example, for which three specific amino acid substitutions are required for adaptation to occur in a 300-amino-acid protein, we found a 3500-fold increase in the rate of adaptation. The probability of a beneficial acquisition decreased if more amino acid changes, or integration of longer DNA fragments, were required for adaptation. The model also predicts that mutators are more likely than nonmutator phenotypes to acquire genetic variability from a more diverged set of donor bacteria. Bacterial populations harboring mutators in a sequence heterogeneous environment are predicted to acquire most of their DNA conferring adaptation in the range of 13-30\% divergence, whereas nonmutator phenotypes become adapted after recombining with more homogeneous sequences of 7-21\% divergence. We conclude that mutators can accelerate bacterial adaptation when desired genetic variability is present within DNA fragments of up to [{\textasciitilde}]30\% divergence.},

Here we examined the rate and process of genome reduction in the bacterium Salmonella enterica by a serial passage experimental evolution procedure. The initial rate of DNA loss was estimated to be 0.05 bp per chromosome per generation for a WT bacterium and \{approx\}50-fold higher for a mutS mutant defective in methyl-directed DNA mismatch repair. The endpoints were identified for seven chromosomal deletions isolated during serial passage and in two separate genetic selections. Deletions ranged in size from 1 to 202 kb, and most of them were not associated with DNA repeats, indicating that they were formed via RecA-independent recombination events. These results suggest that extensive genome reduction can occur on a short evolutionary time scale and that RecA-dependent homologous recombination only plays a limited role in this process of jettisoning superfluous DNA.},

This chapter studies the genus Rhodosporidium. In the determination of asexual reproduction it is found that yeast cells are globose, ovoid, or elongate and budding is multilateral or polar. Ballistoconidia are not formed. Visible carotenoid pigments are formed and the cultures are pink to orange in color. In sexual reproduction it is seen that some species are heterothallic, whereas others are self-fertile. The hyphae have clamp connections. This chapter further examines physiology, biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. The type species mentioned is Rhodosporidium toruloides. The species accepted are Rhodosporidium azoricum, Rhodosporidium babjevae, Rhodosporidium diobovatum, Rhodosporidium fluviale, Rhodosporidium kratochvilovae, Rhodosporidium lusitaniae, Rhodosporidium paludigenum, Rhodosporidium sphaerocarpum, and Rhodosporidium toruloides.

We apply the methods to estimate levels of constraint in noncoding DNA of Drosophila. In introns, constraint (the estimated fraction of mutations that are selectively eliminated) is absolute at the 5' and 3' splice junction dinucleotides, and averages 72\% in base pairs 3-6 at the 5'-end. Constraint at the 5' base pairs 3-6 is significantly lower in the lineage leading to Drosophila melanogaster than in Drosophila simulans, a finding that agrees with other features of genome evolution in Drosophila and indicates that the effect of selection on intron function has been weaker in the melanogaster lineage. Elsewhere in intron sequences, the rate of nucleotide substitution is significantly higher than at synonymous sites. By using intronic sites outside splice control regions as a putative neutrally evolving standard, constraint in the 500 bp of intergenic DNA upstream and downstream regions of protein-coding genes averages \~{}44\%. Although the estimated level of constraint in intergenic regions close to genes is only about one-half of that of amino acid sites, selection against single-nucleotide mutations in intergenic DNA makes a substantial contribution to the mutation load in Drosophila.},

The possibility that climate change is being reinforced by increased carbon dioxide emissions from soils owing to rising temperature is the subject of a continuing debate. But evidence for the suggested feedback mechanism has to date come solely from small-scale laboratory and field experiments and modelling studies. Here we use data from the National Soil Inventory of England and Wales obtained between 1978 and 2003 to show that carbon was lost from soils across England and Wales over the survey period at a mean rate of 0.6\% yr(-1) (relative to the existing soil carbon content). We find that the relative rate of carbon loss increased with soil carbon content and was more than 2\% yr(-1) in soils with carbon contents greater than 100 g kg(-1). The relationship between rate of carbon loss and carbon content is irrespective of land use, suggesting a link to climate change. Our findings indicate that losses of soil carbon in England and Wales--and by inference in other temperate regions-are likely to have been offsetting absorption of carbon by terrestrial sinks.},

This chapter studies the genus Phaffomyces. In the determination of the asexual reproduction, it is seen that cell division is by multilateral budding on a narrow base. Cells are spherical, ellipsoidal, or elongate. Rudimentary pseudohyphae are formed, but true hyphae are not produced. Colonies are butyrous and often have a glistening surface. In sexual reproduction it is found that asci may be unconjugated or show conjugation between independent cells. Known species are heterothallic. Asci form two to four hat-shaped ascospores and are deliquescent. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Phaffomyces opuntiae. The key characters of species assigned to the genus Phaffomyces are presented. In the systematic discussion of the species, synonyms, growth on 5\% malt extract agar, growth on the surface of assimilation media, Dalmau plate culture on morphology agar, formation of ascospores, gene sequence accession numbers, type strain, origin of the strains studied, complementary mating types, systematics, and ecology are determined.},

However, recurrent mutation can produce patterns of genetic diversity similar to those generated by recombination and can bias estimates of the population recombination rate. HUDSON 2001 has suggested an approximate-likelihood method based on coalescent theory to estimate the population recombination rate, 4Ner, under an infinite-sites model of sequence evolution. Here we extend the method to the estimation of the recombination rate in genomes, such as those of many viruses and bacteria, where the rate of recurrent mutation is high. In addition, we develop a powerful permutation-based method for detecting recombination that is both more powerful than other permutation-based methods and robust to misspecification of the model of sequence evolution. We apply the method to sequence data from viruses, bacteria, and human mitochondrial DNA. The extremely high level of recombination detected in both HIV1 and HIV2 sequences demonstrates that recombination cannot be ignored in the analysis of viral population genetic data.},

This chapter studies the genus Komagataella. In the determination of asexual reproduction, yeast cells arise by multilateral budding on a narrow base and are spherical to ovoid in shape. Neither pseudohyphae nor true hyphae are produced. In sexual reproduction it is seen that asci may be unconjugated or show conjugation between a cell and its bud or between independent cells. Asci produce one to four hat-shaped ascospores and the spores may be quickly or slowly liberated. Known species are homothallic. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that glucose is fermented but other sugars are not. This study further examines the phylogenetic placement. The type of species mentioned is Komagataella pastoris. The species accepted are Komagataella pastoris, Komagataella phaffii, and Komagataella pseudopastoris. The systematic discussion of the species includes growth on 5\% malt extract agar, growth on the surface of assimilation media, Dalmau plate culture on morphology agar, formation of ascospores, origin of the strains studied, authentic strain, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

	abstract = {Understanding the origins of localized substitution rate heterogeneity has important implications for identifying functional genomic sequences. Outside of gene regions, the origins of rate heterogeneity remain unclear. Experimental studies establish that chromatin compaction affects rates of both DNA lesion formation and repair. A functional association between chromatin status and 5-methyl-cytosine also exists. These suggest that both the total rate and the type of substitution will be affected by chromatin status. Regular positioning of nucleosomes, the building block of chromatin, further predicts that substitution rate and type should vary spatially in an oscillating manner. We addressed chromatin's influence on substitution rate and type in primates. Matched numbers of sites were sampled from Dnase I hypersensitive (DHS) and closed chromatin control flank (Flank). Likelihood ratio tests revealed significant excesses of total and of transition substitutions in Flank compared with matched DHS for both intergenic and intronic samples. An additional excess of CpG transitions was evident for the intergenic, but not intronic, regions. Fluctuation in substitution rate along approximately 1,800 primate promoters was measured using phylogenetic footprinting. Significant positive correlations were evident between the substitution rate and a nucleosome score from resting human T-cells, with up to approximately 50\% of the variance in substitution rate accounted for. Using signal processing techniques, a dominant oscillation at approximately 200 bp was evident in both the substitution rate and the nucleosome score. Our results support a role for differential DNA repair rates between open and closed chromatin in the spatial distribution of rate heterogeneity.},

Adjacent introns tend to be lost in concert, as expected if such events span multiple intron positions. Directly contrary to the expectations of some, introns that do not interrupt codons (phase zero) are more, not less, likely to be lost, an intriguing and previously unappreciated result. Adjacent introns with matching phases are not more likely to be retained, as would be expected if they enjoyed a relative selective advantage. The findings of 3' and phase zero intron loss biases are in direct contradiction to an extremely recent study of fungi intron evolution. All patterns are less pronounced in the lineage leading to Caenorhabditis elegans, suggesting that the process of intron loss may be qualitatively different in nematodes.

This chapter reviews the studies of the ecology of yeasts in their natural habitats, and the ways in which yeasts have been used to investigate ecological questions. Yeasts are among the earlier colonizers of nutrient rich substrates, where they are followed by a succession of organisms that degrade dead organic matter. However, yeasts are not just decomposers but can assume a diversity of forms and functions in the natural world. Along with their role in the transformation of nutrients, they can engage in intimate relationships with other organisms as mutualists, competitors, parasites, or pathogens. They occur together in communities or guilds linked together through intricate interrelationships. Yeasts are widely distributed throughout all biomes of the world. They have been found in the upper levels of the atmosphere (above the clouds in the stratosphere), in the deepest parts of the oceans, in aquifers under the sea, in ancient glacial ice, and are abundant throughout the phyllosphere. Associates of yeasts include viruses, bacteria, other fungi, algae, vascular plants, and animals of almost any sort.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Currently, re-sequencing approaches use multiple modules serially to interpret raw sequencing data from next-generation sequencing platforms, while remaining oblivious to the genomic information until the final alignment step. Such approaches fail to exploit the full information from both raw sequencing data and the reference genome that can yield better quality sequence reads, SNP-calls, variant detection, as well as an alignment at the best possible location in the reference genome. Thus, there is a need for novel reference-guided bioinformatics algorithms for interpreting analog signals representing sequences of the bases (\{A, C, G, T\}), while simultaneously aligning possible sequence reads to a source reference genome whenever available. RESULTS: Here, we propose a new base-calling algorithm, TotalReCaller, to achieve improved performance. A linear error model for the raw intensity data and Burrows-Wheeler transform (BWT) based alignment are combined utilizing a Bayesian score function, which is then globally optimized over all possible genomic locations using an efficient branch-and-bound approach. The algorithm has been implemented in soft- and hardware [field-programmable gate array (FPGA)] to achieve real-time performance. Empirical results on real high-throughput Illumina data were used to evaluate TotalReCaller's performance relative to its peers-Bustard, BayesCall, Ibis and Rolexa-based on several criteria, particularly those important in clinical and scientific applications. Namely, it was evaluated for (i) its base-calling speed and throughput, (ii) its read accuracy and (iii) its specificity and sensitivity in variant calling.

We examine complexities involved in those steps and propose a new approximate method that takes into account two major features of DNA sequence evolution: transition/transversion rate bias and base/codon frequency bias. We compare the new method with maximum likelihood, as well as several other approximate methods, by examining infinitely long sequences, performing computer simulations, and analyzing a real data set. The results suggest that when there are transition/transversion rate biases and base/codon frequency biases, previously described approximate methods for estimating the nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio may involve serious biases, and the bias can be both positive and negative. The new method is, in general, superior to earlier approximate methods and may be useful for analyzing large data sets, although maximum likelihood appears to always be the method of choice.},

This chapter studies the genus Coccidiascus. In the determination of asexual reproduction, asexual cells are spherical to ovoid, 5{\textendash}15 $\mu$m in length, have a large vacuole and nucleus, and reproduce by budding. Hyphae, pseudohyphae, and ballistoconidia are lacking. In sexual reproduction it is seen that asexual cells transform into elongated asci, which are banana- or crescent-shaped, and arranged within parasitophorous vacuoles of Drosophila intestinal epithelium cells in the manner of coccidian schizonts. Thick-walled asci observed in host tissue range from 13{\textendash}18 $\mu$m tip to tip. Mature asci contain two relatively thin-walled ascospores, closely intertwined in a helix. Asci from dead flies have been observed to contain up to eight ascospores. Ascospores extruded from asci are spindle-shaped, bilaterally flattened, and without apical cytoplasmic appendages, each with an apical nucleus. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that the single known species of this genus has not been obtained in axenic culture and fermentation, and assimilation reactions are unknown. This chapter further examines the phylogenetic placement. The type of species mentioned is Coccidiascus legeri. The systematic discussion of the species mentioned is type strain.},

	abstract = {It has been suggested that humans may suffer a high genomic deleterious mutation rate,. Here we test this hypothesis by applying a variant of a molecular approach to estimate the deleterious mutation rate in hominids from the level of selective constraint in DNA sequences. Under conservative assumptions, we estimate that an average of 4.2 amino-acid-altering mutations per diploid per generation have occurred in the human lineage since humans separated from chimpanzees. Of these mutations, we estimate that at least 38\% have been eliminated by natural selection, indicating that there have been more than 1.6 new deleterious mutations per diploid genome per generation. Thus, the deleterious mutation rate specific to protein-coding sequences alone is close to the upper limit tolerable by a species such as humans that has a low reproductive rate, indicating that the effects of deleterious mutations may have combined synergistically. Furthermore, the level of selective constraint in hominid protein-coding sequences is atypically low. A large number of slightly deleterious mutations may therefore have become fixed in hominid lineages.},

Annotation of DNA sequences homologous to known repetitive elements has been mainly performed with the program REPEATMASKER.

Although REPEATMASKER annotation is indispensable for studying genome biology, this annotation does not contain much information on the common origin of fossil fragments that share an insertion event, especially where clusters of nested insertions of repetitive elements have occurred.RESULTS:Here I present REANNOTATE, a computational tool to process REPEATMASKER annotation for automated i) defragmentation of dispersed repetitive elements, ii) resolution of the temporal order of insertions in clusters of nested elements, and iii) estimating the age of the elements, if they have long terminal repeats. I have re-annotated the repetitive content of human chromosomes, providing evidence for a recent expansion of satellite repeats on the Y chromosome and, from the retroviral age distribution, for a higher rate of evolution on the Y relative to autosomes.CONCLUSION:REANNOTATE is ready to process existing annotation for automated evolutionary analysis of all types of complex repeats in any genome.

This chapter studies the genus Magnusiomyces. In the determination of the asexual reproduction, it is seen that colonies are white, farinose or hairy, usually dry, and consist of true hyphae that branch at acute angles with acuminate apices and disarticulate into arthroconidia. Additional sympodial and annellidic conidiogenesis may be present. Septa have micropores. In sexual reproduction it is found that gametangia form on opposite sides of hyphal septa, become broadly ellipsoidal, soon fuse entirely, and are transformed to an ascus. Asci are hyaline, subspherical to broadly ellipsoidal, and contain four ascospores. Ascospores are ellipsoidal to broadly ellipsoidal, hyaline, and have smooth walls surrounded by regular slime sheaths. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Magnusiomyces magnusii. The key characters of species assigned to the genus Magnusiomyces are presented. In the systematic discussion of the species, anamorph, synonyms, growth on 4\% malt extract/0.5\% yeast extract agar, growth radius on glucose-peptone-yeast extract agar, formation of ascospores, gene sequence accession numbers, type strain, cell carbohydrates, origin of the strains studied, complementary mating types, and systematics are determined.},

This chapter studies the genus Starmera. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that cell division is by multilateral budding on a narrow base. Cells are spherical, ellipsoidal, or elongate. Rudimentary pseudohyphae are formed, but true hyphae are not produced. Colonies are butyrous and usually have a glistening surface. In sexual reproduction it is found that the asci may be unconjugated or show conjugation between independent cells or between a cell and its bud. Depending on the species, asci are deliquescent or persistent and form one to four hat-shaped ascospores. Some species of the genus are heterothallic, whereas other species appear to be homothallic. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which glucose may be fermented but other sugars are not fermented. Relatively few of the sugars and polyols in standard yeast growth tests are assimilated. One species assimilates nitrate, whereas the others do not. Some species require an exogenous source of L-methionine or L-cysteine. The type species taken is Starmera amethionina.},

	volume = {165},

	abstract = {Intron sizes show an asymmetrical distribution in a number of organisms, with a large number of "short" introns clustered around a minimal intron length and a much broader distribution of longer introns. In Drosophila melanogaster, the short intron class is centered around 61 bp. The narrow length distribution suggests that natural selection may play a role in maintaining intron size. A comparison of 15 orthologous introns among species of the D. melanogaster subgroup indicates that, in general, short introns are not under greater DNA sequence or length constraints than long introns. There is a bias toward deletions in all introns (deletion/insertion ratio is 1.66), and the vast majority of indels are of short length ({\textless}10 bp). Indels occurring on the internal branches of the phylogenetic tree are significantly longer than those occurring on the terminal branches. These results are consistent with a compensatory model of intron length evolution in which slightly deleterious short deletions are frequently fixed within species by genetic drift, and relatively rare larger insertions that restore intron length are fixed by positive selection. A comparison of paralogous introns shared among duplicated genes suggests that length constraints differ between introns within the same gene. The janusA, janusB, and ocnus genes share two short introns derived from a common ancestor. The first of these introns shows significantly fewer indels than the second intron, although the two introns show a comparable number of substitutions. This indicates that intron-specific selective constraints have been maintained following gene duplication, which preceded the divergence of the D. melanogaster species subgroup.},

This chapter studies the genus Pichia. In the determination of the asexual reproduction, it is seen that budding is multilateral on a narrow base. Cells are spherical, ovoid, or short elongate. Pseudohyphae may occur but true hyphae are not formed. In sexual reproduction it is found that asci are unconjugated or show conjugation between a parent cell and its bud or between independent cells. Some species are heterothallic, whereas others are homothallic. Asci may be persistent or deliquescent and form one to four, or rarely five to eight, ascospores. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Pichia membranifaciens. The key phenotypic characteristics of species assigned to the genus Pichia are presented. In the systematic discussion of the species, growth on 5\% malt extract agar, growth on the surface of assimilation media, Dalmau plate culture on morphology agar, formation of ascospores, gene sequence accession numbers, type strain, origin of the strains studied, systematics, and ecology are determined.},

	abstract = {Author SummaryImprovements in DNA sequencing technology have allowed genetic variation to be studied at the level of fully sequenced genomes. We have sequenced more than 100 D. melanogaster genomes originating from sub-Saharan Africa, which is thought to contain the ancestral range of this model organism. We found evidence for recent and substantial non-African gene flow into African populations, which may be driven by natural selection. The data also helped to refine our understanding of the species' history, which may have involved a geographic expansion from southern central Africa (e.g. Zambia). Lastly, we identified a large number of genes and functions that may have experienced recent adaptive evolution in one or more populations. An understanding of genomic variation in ancestral range populations of D. melanogaster will improve our ability to make population genetic inferences for worldwide populations. The results presented here should motivate statistical, mathematical, and computational studies to identify evolutionary models that are most compatible with observed data. Finally, the potential signals of natural selection identified here should facilitate detailed follow-up studies on the genetic basis of adaptive evolutionary change.},

Here we report that chromatin structure also affects laboratory DNA manipulation in ways that distort the results of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments. We initially discovered this effect at the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HMR locus, where we found that silenced chromatin was refractory to shearing, relative to euchromatin. Using input samples from ChIP-Seq studies, we detected a similar bias throughout the heterochromatic portions of the yeast genome. We also observed significant chromatin-related effects at telomeres, protein binding sites, and genes, reflected in the variation of input-Seq coverage. Experimental tests of candidate regions showed that chromatin influenced shearing at some loci, and that chromatin could also lead to enriched or depleted DNA levels in prepared samples, independently of shearing effects. Our results suggested that assays relying on immunoprecipitation of chromatin will be biased by intrinsic differences between regions packaged into different chromatin structures - biases which have been largely ignored to date. These results established the pervasiveness of this bias genome-wide, and suggested that this bias can be used to detect differences in chromatin structures across the genome.},

	abstract = {New sequencing technologies promise a new era in the use of DNA sequence. However, some of these technologies produce very short reads, typically of a few tens of base pairs, and to use these reads effectively requires new algorithms and software. In particular, there is a major issue in efficiently aligning short reads to a reference genome and handling ambiguity or lack of accuracy in this alignment. Here we introduce the concept of mapping quality, a measure of the confidence that a read actually comes from the position it is aligned to by the mapping algorithm. We describe the software MAQ that can build assemblies by mapping shotgun short reads to a reference genome, using quality scores to derive genotype calls of the consensus sequence of a diploid genome, e.g., from a human sample. MAQ makes full use of mate-pair information and estimates the error probability of each read alignment. Error probabilities are also derived for the final genotype calls, using a Bayesian statistical model that incorporates the mapping qualities, error probabilities from the raw sequence quality scores, sampling of the two haplotypes, and an empirical model for correlated errors at a site. Both read mapping and genotype calling are evaluated on simulated data and real data. MAQ is accurate, efficient, versatile, and user-friendly. It is freely available at http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

The detection of polymorphisms by restriction analysis of PCR-amplified cpDNA fragments allowed the identification of 23 haplotypes that were phylogenetically ordered. A systematic hybridization and introgression between the eight species studied is evident. The levels of subdivision for unordered (GST) and ordered (NST) alleles are very high and close (0.83 and 0.85). A new statistical approach to the quantitative study of phylogeography is presented, which relies on the coefficients of differentiation GST and NST and the Mantel's test. Based on pairwise comparisons between populations, the significance of the difference between both coefficients is evaluated at a global and a local scale. The mapped distribution of the haplotypes indicates the probable routes of postglacial recolonization followed by oak populations that had persisted in southern refugia, especially in the Iberian peninsula, Italy and the Balkans. Most cpDNA polymorphisms appear to be anterior to the befinnina of the last recolonization. A subset of the preexisting haplotypes have merely expanded north, while others were left behind in the south.},

Their combinations define haplotypes, with higher order repeats (HORs) containing identical or closely-related haplotypes tandemly arranged into separate domains. The haplotypes found on homologues can be totally different, while HORs remain 99.8\% homogeneous both intrachromosomally and between homologues. These results support the hypothesis, never before demonstrated, that unequal crossovers between sister chromatids accumulate to produce homogenization and amplification into tandem alphoid repeats. I propose that the molecular basis of this involves the diagnostic variant nucleotides, which enable pairing between HORs with identical or closely-related haplotypes. Domains are thus periodically renewed to maintain high intrachromosomal and interhomologue homogeneity. The capacity of a domain to form an active centromere is maintained as long as neither retrotransposons nor significant numbers of mutations affect it. In the presented model, a chromosome with an altered centromere can be transiently rescued by forming a neocentromere, until a restored, fully-competent domain is amplified de novo or rehomogenized through the accumulation of unequal crossovers.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND:Escherichia coli is the model organism for which our knowledge of its regulatory network is the most extensive. Over the last few years, our project has been collecting and curating the literature concerning E. coli transcription initiation and operons, providing in both the RegulonDB and EcoCyc databases the largest electronically encoded network available. A paper published recently by Ma et al. (2004) showed several differences in the versions of the network present in these two databases.Discrepancies have been corrected, annotations from this and other groups (Shen-Orr et al., 2002) have been added, making the RegulonDB and EcoCyc databases the largest comprehensive and constantly curated regulatory network of E. coli K-12.RESULTS:Several groups have been using these curated data as part of their bioinformatics and systems biology projects, in combination with external data obtained from other sources, thus enlarging the dataset initially obtained from either RegulonDB or EcoCyc of the E. coli K12 regulatory network. We kindly obtained from the groups of Uri Alon and Hong-Wu Ma the interactions they have added to enrich their public versions of the E. coli regulatory network. These were used to search for original references and curate them with the same standards we use regularly, adding in several cases the original references (instead of reviews or missing references), as well as adding the corresponding experimental evidence codes. We also corrected all discrepancies in the two databases available as explained below.CONCLUSION:One hundred and fifty new interactions have been added to our databases as a result of this specific curation effort, in addition to those added as a result of our continuous curation work. RegulonDB gene names are now based on those of EcoCyc to avoid confusion due to gene names and synonyms, and the public releases of RegulonDB and EcoCyc are henceforth synchronized to avoid confusion due to different versions. Public flat files are available providing direct access to the regulatory network interactions thus avoiding errors due to differences in database modelling and representation. The regulatory network available in RegulonDB and EcoCyc is the most comprehensive and regularly updated electronically-encoded regulatory network of E. coli K-12.},

Bringing an end to global biodiversity loss requires that limited available resources be guided to those regions that need it most. The biodiversity hotspots do this based on the conservation planning principles of irreplaceability and vulnerability. Here, we review the development of the hotspots over the past two decades and present an analysis of their biodiversity, updated to the current set of 35 regions. We then discuss past and future efforts needed to conserve them, sustaining their fundamental role both as the home of a substantial fraction of global biodiversity and as the ultimate source of many ecosystem services upon which humanity depends.},

This chapter studies the genus Priceomyces. In the determination of the asexual reproduction, it is seen that cell division is by multilateral budding on a narrow base, and budded cells are spherical to elongate. Pseudohyphae are formed by some species, but true hyphae are absent. In sexual reproduction it is found that the asci may be unconjugated or form following conjugation between a cell and its bud or between independent cells. Asci, which are deliquescent or persistent, form one to four ascospores that may be hat-shaped, spherical with a smooth surface, or spherical with a roughened surface. Currently known species are homothallic. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which sugars are not fermented but many of the sugars, polyols, and organic acids used for yeast identification tests are assimilated. Nitrate is not assimilated, the major ubiquinone formed is CoQ-9, and the diazonium blue B test is negative. The type species taken is Priceomyces haplophilus. Species now classified in Priceomyces were variously assigned to the genera Debaryomyces, Pichia, Torulaspora, and Yamadazyma. Prior generic assignments were strongly influenced by ascospore morphology. P.carsonii produces smooth, spherical ascospores, prompting its placement at various times in Pichia, Debaryomyces, and Torulaspora.},

	abstract = {The pattern of mutational covariance among traits plays a central, but largely untested role in many theories in evolutionary genetics. Here we estimate the pattern of phenotypic, environmental and mutational correlations for a set of life-history, behavioral and morphological traits using 67 self-fertilizing lines of Caenorhabditis elegans, each having independently experienced an average of 370 generations of spontaneous mutation accumulation. Bivariate relationships of mutational effects indicate the existence of extensive pleiotropy. We find that mutations may tend to produce manifold effects on suites of functionally related traits; however, our data do not support the idea of completely parcelated pleiotropy, in which functional units are separately affected by mutations. Positive net phenotypic and mutational correlations are common for life-history traits, with environmental correlations being comparatively smaller and of the same sign for most pairs of traits. Observed mutational correlations are shown to be higher than those produced by the chance accumulation of nonpleiotropic mutations in the same lines.},

Our analysis suggests that the per-base-pair mutation rates at two genes differ significantly (3.80 x 1010 at URA3 and 6.44 x 1010 at CAN1) and we propose a definition for the effective target size of genes (the probability that a mutation inactivates the gene) that acknowledges that the mutation rate is nonuniform across the genome.},

	abstract = {The increasing availability of mitochondrial (mt) sequence data from various yeasts provides a tool to study genomic evolution within and between different species. While the genomes from a range of lineages are available, there is a lack of information concerning intraspecific mtDNA diversity. Here, we analyzed the mt genomes of 50 strains from Lachancea thermotolerans, a protoploid yeast species that has been isolated from several locations (Europe, Asia, Australia, South Africa, and North / South America) and ecological sources (fruit, tree exudate, plant material, and grape and agave fermentations). Protein-coding genes from the mtDNA were used to construct a phylogeny, which reflected a similar, yet less resolved topology than the phylogenetic tree of 50 nuclear genes. In comparison to its sister species Lachancea kluyveri, L. thermotolerans has a smaller mt genome. This is due to shorter intergenic regions and fewer introns, of which the latter are only found in COX1. We revealed that L. kluyveri and L. thermotolerans share similar levels of intraspecific divergence concerning the nuclear genomes. However, L. thermotolerans has a more highly conserved mt genome with the coding regions characterized by low rates of nonsynonymous substitution. Thus, in the mt genomes of L. thermotolerans, stronger purifying selection and lower mutation rates potentially shape genome diversity in contract to what was found for L. kluyveri, demonstrating that the factors driving mt genome evolution are different even between closely related species.},

This chapter focuses on DNA analyses through phylogenetic analyses of amino acid sequences and other kinds of molecular data. Molecular phylogenetic reconstruction has become the decisive tool in systematics and taxonomy, and began to be used for yeasts earlier than in any other eukaryotic group. The approach is straightforward in a discipline of systematic biology where living strains are preserved for each described species, and morphological characters that delimit species are sparse. The partial rDNA sequences are available for each yeast species. The first sequenced genome of a eukaryote was that of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and subsequently, more genomes have been sequenced in ascomycetous yeasts than for any other group of eukaryotes, making these organisms the most intensively studied group in phylogenomics. Phylogenetic hypotheses are most frequently illustrated in tree-shaped graphs, consisting of nodes (which represent species), and branches (which determine the ancestor relationships). The terminal nodes of a tree represent the extant species from which the molecular sequences were derived; the inner nodes represent hypothetical ancestral species.},

	abstract = {A genomewide screen of a collection of 4,847 yeast gene deletion mutants was carried out to identify the genes required for suppressing mutations in the CAN1 forward-mutation assay. The primary screens and subsequent analysis allowed (i) identification of 18 known mutator mutants, providing a solid means for checking the efficiency of the screen, and (ii) identification of a number of genes not known previously to be involved in suppressing mutations. Among the previously uncharacterized mutation-suppressing genes were six genes of unknown function including four (CSM2, SHU2, SHU1, and YLR376c) encoding proteins that interact with each other and promote resistance to killing by methyl methanesulfonate, one gene (EGL1) previously identified as suppressing Ty1 mobility and recombination between repeated sequences, and one gene (YLR154c) that was not associated with any known processes. In addition, five genes (TSA1, SOD1, LYS7, SKN7, and YAP1) implicated in the oxidative-stress responses were found to play a significant role in mutation suppression. Furthermore, TSA1, which encodes thioredoxin peroxidase, was found to strongly suppress gross chromosomal rearrangements. These results provide a global view of the nonessential genes involved in preventing mutagenesis. Study of such genes should provide useful clues in identification of human genes potentially involved in cancer predisposition and in understanding their mechanisms of action.},

This chapter studies the genus Kuraishia. In the determination of asexual reproduction, budding is multilateral on a narrow base, and cells are spherical to ellipsoidal. Pseudohyphae and true hyphae are not produced. Colonies are smooth and tannish-white in color. In sexual reproduction it is seen that conjugation usually precedes ascus formation. Asci are deliquescent and form one to four hat-shaped ascospores. This study further examines the physiology, biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. The type of species mentioned is Kuraishia capsulata. The species accepted are Kuraishia capsulata and Kuraishia molischiana. The systematic discussion of the species includes growth on 5\% malt extract agar, growth on the surface of 5\% malt extract, Dalmau plate culture on morphology agar, formation of ascospores, origin of the strains studied, authentic strain, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

	abstract = {Stowaway is a superfamily of miniature inverted repeat transposable elements (MITEs) that is widespread and abundant in plant genomes. Like other MITEs, however, its origin and mode of amplification are poorly understood. Several lines of evidence point to plant mariner-like elements (MLEs) as the autonomous partners of the nonautonomous Stowaway MITEs. To better understand this relationship, we have taken advantage of the nearly complete genome sequences of two rice subspecies to generate the first inventory of virtually all MLEs and Stowaway families coexisting in a single plant species. Thirty-four different MLEs were found to group into three major clades and 25 families. More than 22,000 Stowaway MITEs were identified and classified into 36 families. On the basis of detailed sequence comparisons, MLEs were confirmed to be the best candidate autonomous elements for Stowaway MITEs. Surprisingly, however, sequence similarity between MLE and Stowaway families was restricted to the terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and, in a few cases, to adjacent subterminal sequences. These data suggest a model whereby most of the Stowaway MITEs in rice were cross-mobilized by MLE transposases encoded by distantly related elements.},

Recombination causes frequent genome rearrangements, horizontal transfer introduces new sequences into bacterial chromosomes, and deletions remove segments of the genome. Consequently, each genome is a mosaic of unique lineage-specific segments, regions shared with a subset of other genomes and segments conserved among all the genomes under consideration. Furthermore, the linear order of these segments may be shuffled among genomes. We present methods for identification and alignment of conserved genomic DNA in the presence of rearrangements and horizontal transfer. Our methods have been implemented in a software package called Mauve. Mauve has been applied to align nine enterobacterial genomes and to determine global rearrangement structure in three mammalian genomes. We have evaluated the quality of Mauve alignments and drawn comparison to other methods through extensive simulations of genome evolution.},

	abstract = {The question of how genetic variation in a population influences phenotypic variation and evolution is of major importance in modern biology. Yet much is still unknown about the relative functional importance of different forms of genome variation and how they are shaped by evolutionary processes. Here we address these questions by population level sequencing of 42 strains from the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its closest relative S. paradoxus. We find that genome content variation, in the form of presence or absence as well as copy number of genetic material, is higher within S. cerevisiae than within S. paradoxus, despite genetic distances as measured in single-nucleotide polymorphisms being vastly smaller within the former species. This genome content variation, as well as loss-of-function variation in the form of premature stop codons and frameshifting indels, is heavily enriched in the subtelomeres, strongly reinforcing the relevance of these regions to functional evolution. Genes affected by these likely functional forms of variation are enriched for functions mediating interaction with the external environment (sugar transport and metabolism, flocculation, metal transport, and metabolism). Our results and analyses provide a comprehensive view of genomic diversity in budding yeast and expose surprising and pronounced differences between the variation within S. cerevisiae and that within S. paradoxus. We also believe that the sequence data and de novo assemblies will constitute a useful resource for further evolutionary and population genomics studies.},

	abstract = {Coding sequence evolution was once thought to be the result of selection on optimal protein function alone. Selection can, however, also act at the RNA level, for example, to facilitate rapid translation or ensure correct splicing. Here, we ask whether the way DNA works also imposes constraints on coding sequence evolution. We identify nucleosome positioning as a likely candidate to set up such a DNA-level selective regime and use high-resolution microarray data in yeast to compare the evolution of coding sequence bound to or free from nucleosomes. Controlling for gene expression and intra-gene location, we find a nucleosome-free "linker" sequence to evolve on average 5-6\% slower at synonymous sites. A reduced rate of evolution in linker is especially evident at the 5' end of genes, where the effect extends to non-synonymous substitution rates. This is consistent with regular nucleosome architecture in this region being important in the context of gene expression control. As predicted, codons likely to generate a sequence unfavourable to nucleosome formation are enriched in linker sequence. Amino acid content is likewise skewed as a function of nucleosome occupancy. We conclude that selection operating on DNA to maintain correct positioning of nucleosomes impacts codon choice, amino acid choice, and synonymous and non-synonymous rates of evolution in coding sequence. The results support the exclusion model for nucleosome positioning and provide an alternative interpretation for runs of rare codons. As the intimate association of histones and DNA is a universal characteristic of genic sequence in eukaryotes, selection on coding sequence composition imposed by nucleosome positioning should be phylogenetically widespread.},

	abstract = {Contributing roughly half of the biosphere's net primary production (NPP), photosynthesis by oceanic phytoplankton is a vital link in the cycling of carbon between living and inorganic stocks. Each day, more than a hundred million tons of carbon in the form of CO2 are fixed into organic material by these ubiquitous, microscopic plants of the upper ocean, and each day a similar amount of organic carbon is transferred into marine ecosystems by sinking and grazing. The distribution of phytoplankton biomass and NPP is defined by the availability of light and nutrients (nitrogen, phosphate, iron). These growth-limiting factors are in turn regulated by physical processes of ocean circulation, mixed-layer dynamics, upwelling, atmospheric dust deposition, and the solar cycle. Satellite measurements of ocean colour provide a means of quantifying ocean productivity on a global scale and linking its variability to environmental factors. Here we describe global ocean NPP changes detected from space over the past decade. The period is dominated by an initial increase in NPP of 1,930 teragrams of carbon a year (Tg C yr-1), followed by a prolonged decrease averaging 190 Tg C yr-1. These trends are driven by changes occurring in the expansive stratified low-latitude oceans and are tightly coupled to coincident climate variability. This link between the physical environment and ocean biology functions through changes in upper-ocean temperature and stratification, which influence the availability of nutrients for phytoplankton growth. The observed reductions in ocean productivity during the recent post-1999 warming period provide insight on how future climate change can alter marine food webs.},

This chapter discusses the genus Cystofilobasidium. It provides a systematic discussion of the species and concludes with comments on the genus. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. In asexual reproduction yeast cells are ovoid or ellipsoid. Asexual reproduction is predominantly by polar budding. Poorly developed pseudohyphae may be present in some species. Ballistoconidia are absent. The cultures have an orange to pinkish color that darkens upon aging, but nonpigmented variants are known in some species. Pigmentation is due to the presence of carotenoid pigments. In sexual reproduction species may be self-sterile (heterothallic) or self-fertile (homothallic). The self-sterile compatibility systems are tetrapolar or bipolar. Depending on the species, clamp connections are present or absent. The septal pore is a dolipore without parenthesomes. Teliospores are formed, which are spherical and dark pigmented, and upon germination form slender, tubular or short, nonseptate basidia with terminal and sessile basidiospores that germinate by budding.},

	abstract = {Population genetics is a highly theoretical field in which many models and theories of broad significance have received little experimental testing. Microbes are well-suited for empirical population genetics since populations of almost any size may be studied genetically, and because many have easily controlled life cycles. Saccharomyces cerevisiae is almost ideal for such studies as the growing body of knowledge and techniques that have made it the best characterized eukaryote genome also allow the experimental manipulation and analysis of its population genetics. In experiments to date, the evolution of laboratory yeast populations has been observed for up to 1000 generations. In several cases, adaptation has occurred by gene duplications. The interaction between mutation, selection and genetic drift at varying population sizes is a major area of theoretical study in which yeast experiments can provide particularly valuable data. Conflicts between gene-level and among-cell selection, and co-evolution between genes within a genome, are additional topics in which a population genetics perspective may be particularly helpful. The growing field of genomics is increasingly complementary with that of population genetics. The characterization of the yeast genome presents unprecedented opportunities for the detailed study of evolutionary and population genetics. Conversely, the redundancy of the yeast genome means that, for many open reading frames, deletion has only a quantitative effect that is most readily observed in competitions with a wild-type strain.},

This chapter discusses the genus Cystobasidium. It provides a systematic discussion of the species and concludes with comments on the genus. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. In asexual reproduction yeast cells are ovoid or elongate and budding is predominantly polar. Ballistoconidia are not formed. Visible carotenoid pigments are formed, and the cultures are pink to orange in color. In sexual reproduction the species is mycoparasitic, and the sexual state develops only when the fungal host is present. Hyphae with clamp connections and haustoria occur. Auricularioid, i.e., transversely septate basidia develop from a swollen, thin-walled probasidium that is not a teliospore. The probasidium tends to collapse when empty. The basidiospores are formed at the end of tubularsterigma. Basidiospores are forcefully ejected and germinate by repetition or budding. They are thin-walled, smooth, and hyaline. Basidiospore germination results in a budding yeast state. In the hyphae the septal pore is {\textquotedblleft}simple{\textquotedblright} and enclosed by a peculiar organelle with a reticulate surface, the cystosome. The salient features of Cystobasidium are the mycoparasitic association with Coprophilus ascomycetes such as Lasiobolus, Saccobolus, and Thelebolus, the transversely septate basidia and the thin-walled and persistent sac-like probasidium that tends to collapse when emptied, the production of tremelloid haustoria, and the presence of a pink yeast stage.},

Using this principle, we analyze noncoding sequence conservation in Drosophila for 40 loci with known or suspected cis-regulatory function encompassing {\textgreater}100 kb of DNA. We estimate the fraction of noncoding DNA conserved in both intergenic and intronic regions and describe the length distribution of ungapped conserved noncoding blocks. On average, 22\%-26\% of noncoding sequences surveyed are conserved in Drosophila, with median block length {\textasciitilde}19 bp. We show that point substitution in conserved noncoding blocks exhibits transition bias as well as lineage effects in base composition, and occurs more than an order of magnitude more frequently than insertion/deletion (indel) substitution. Overall, patterns of noncoding DNA structure and evolution differ remarkably little between intergenic and intronic conserved blocks, suggesting that the effects of transcription per se contribute minimally to the constraints operating on these sequences. The results of this study have implications for the development of alignment and prediction algorithms specific to noncoding DNA, as well as for models of cis-regulatory DNA sequence evolution.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter studies the genus Metschnikowia. In the determination of the asexual reproduction, it is seen that budding is multilateral. Cells are spherical to ellipsoid or can be pyriform, cylindroid, or lunate. Pseudohyphae are poorly developed but rarely lacking. Some species form long aseptate germ tubes reminiscent of true hyphae. In sexual reproduction it is found that the asci are elongate, clavate, sphaeropedunculate, or ellipsoidopedunculate. Ascospores are needle-shaped, attenuated at one or both ends, occasionally swollen along one half, and without a whip-like appendage. One or two spores form per ascus, depending on the species. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Metschnikowia bicuspidata. The extent of sequence divergence in Metschnikowia is worthy of attention. Measured in terms of substitutions in ribosomal genes, the phylogenetic distance between members of the various subclades can exceed the distance separating Schizosaccharomyces and various genera in the Saccharomycetaceae. Adherence to a typological genus definition, based on the molecular clock, would dictate the subdivision of Metschnikowia into several genera that would be distinguishable only on the basis of the sequences. The principal habitats where Metschnikowia species are encountered with regularity include the flowers, fruit, other plant tissues, and the digestive tract or frass of some of the insects that visit these substrates. The nature of the association between Metschnikowia species and insects remains unclear, but it is clear that the relationship can be highly specific.},

Although this complexity makes a comprehensive genetic analysis difficult, identification of even a single gene provides insight into the biochemical and/or signaling pathway underlying a trait. However, it is unknown whether multiple pathways, and consequently multiple genes, must be identified to adequately understand a trait's molecular basis. Using crosses between three natural isolates of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we mapped sensitivity to a number of pharmacologically active compounds to a single nonsynonymous polymorphism in cystathione--synthase (CYS4), which is required for the first committed step in the cysteine biosynthesis pathway. Drug sensitivity is mediated by a deficiency in cysteine and consequently glutathione production, because drug sensitivity is abrogated by cysteine or glutathione supplementation. Within a diverse panel of 60 natural yeast isolates, the drug-sensitive CYS4 allele is rare, and glutathione supplementation failed to alleviate drug-dependent growth defects in two other drug-sensitive strains. These results implicate the cysteine/glutathione biosynthesis pathway as a significant, but not the sole contributor to pharmacological variation in yeast. 10.1073/pnas.0708194104},

This chapter describes Ascobotryozyma, which was erected as a new genus to accommodate the teleomorphic state of Botryozyma. The type species, A. americana, was considered novel because of its North American distribution, in addition to molecular, morphological, and physiological comparisons. A second species, A. cognata, was found in similar habitats and in close proximity to A. americana, but was considered novel based on molecular, morphological, and physiological criteria. All Ascobotryozyma and Botryozyma strains are discovered on Panagrellus nematodes, which typically inhabit fermenting and acidic environments such as slime fluxes from trees or associated with Drosophila flies. Insects attracted to these fermenting environments because of their scent presumably vector the nematodes. Ascbotryozyma appears to be widely, but not densely, dispersed. Asci are evanescent with passively discharged ascospores. Asci and ascospore production of Ascobotryozyma cannot be maintained in pure agar culture.},

This chapter studies the genus Saccharomyces. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that budding is multilateral and cells are globose, ellipsoid, or cylindroid. Pseudohyphae may be formed, but septate hyphae are absent. In sexual reproduction it is found that the asexual state may be haploid but is often diploid or of higher ploidy. Conjugation may occur between complementary mating types, or, more commonly, diploid cells convert directly into asci. Ascospores are globose to short ellipsoid, with a smooth wall, and there are usually one to four per ascus. Asci are persistent. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which fermentation is normally vigorous, starch-like compounds are not produced, and no growth occurs with nitrate as a sole source of nitrogen. The major ubiquinone is CoQ-6 and the diazonium blue B reaction is negative. The type species taken is Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Five of the currently accepted species of Saccharomyces (S. aboricolus, S. cariocanus, S. mikatae, S. kudriavzevii, and S. paradoxus) are found in natural environments.},

	abstract = {This book is unique in providing a comprehensive, up-to-date synthesis of what is known about soil biodiversity and the factors that regulate its distribution, as well as the functional significance of below-ground biodiversity for ecosystem form and function. It describes the vast diversity of biota that live in the soil environment - the most complex habitat on Earth - and discusses the factors that act as determinants of this diversity across different spatial and temporal scales. The Biology of Soil also considers how biotic interactions in soil influence the important soil processes of decomposition and nutrient cycling . It demonstrates how interactions and feedbacks between diverse plant and soil communities act as important drivers of ecosystem form and function. The importance of these relationships for understanding how ecosystems respond to global change phenomena, including climate change, is discussed in depth. Much is still to be learned about the soil biota and their roles in ecosystems, and the author highlights some of the many challenges that face ecologists in the exploration of soil. Richard Bardgett has wide experience in soil and terrestrial ecology, and his background of research in many ecosystems is reflected in this book which is the most comprehensive, up-to-date volume currently available in soil ecology. It provides an introduction to the biology of soil, and it also discusses the most recent developments in this progressive field of ecology. The importance of soil biotic interactions for community and ecosystem ecology is illustrated through the use of numerous examples and case studies. The Biology of Soil provides an excellent, easy to read introduction for anyone working in the field of soil ecology and related disciplines, and will be ideal for students taking undergraduate and postgraduate courses in soil ecology, plant-soil relationships, ecosystem ecology, and land management.},

	abstract = {The Drosophila melanogaster genome contains approximately 100 distinct families of transposable elements (TEs). In the euchromatic part of the genome, each family is present in a small number of copies (5-150 copies), with individual copies of TEs often present at very low frequencies in populations. This pattern is likely to reflect a balance between the inflow of TEs by transposition and the removal of TEs by natural selection. The nature of natural selection acting against TEs remains controversial. We provide evidence that selection against chromosome abnormalities caused by ectopic recombination limits the spread of some TEs. We also demonstrate for the first time that some TE families in the Drosophila euchromatin appear to be only marginally affected by purifying selection and contain many copies at high population frequencies. We argue that TEs in these families attain high population frequencies and even reach fixation as a result of low family-wide transposition rates leading to low TE copy numbers and consequently reduced strength of selection acting on individual TE copies. Fixation of TEs in these families should provide an upward pressure on the size of intergenic sequences counterbalancing rapid DNA loss through small deletions. Copy-number-dependent selection on TE families caused by ectopic recombination may also promote diversity among TEs in the Drosophila genome.},

This is important in regulating marine carbon cycling and ocean{\textendash}atmosphere CO2 exchange. The present rise in atmospheric CO2 levels causes significant changes in surface ocean pH and carbonate chemistry. Such changes have been shown to slow down calcification in corals and coralline macroalgae , , but the majority of marine calcification occurs in planktonic organisms. Here we report reduced calcite production at increased CO2 concentrations in monospecific cultures of two dominant marine calcifying phytoplankton species, the coccolithophorids Emiliania huxleyi and Gephyrocapsa oceanica . This was accompanied by an increased proportion of malformed coccoliths and incomplete coccospheres. Diminished calcification led to a reduction in the ratio of calcite precipitation to organic matter production. Similar results were obtained in incubations of natural plankton assemblages from the north Pacific ocean when exposed to experimentally elevated CO2 levels. We suggest that the progressive increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations may therefore slow down the production of calcium carbonate in the surface ocean. As the process of calcification releases CO2 to the atmosphere, the response observed here could potentially act as a negative feedback on atmospheric CO2 levels.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
The presence of ballistoconidia in Sporobolomyces led Kluyver and van Niel to suggest that this yeast is basidiomycetous, based on the morphological resemblance of ballistoconidia with actively discharged basidiospores. The life cycles of basidiomycetous yeasts include heterothallic and homothallic systems, which may occur within a single species. In the heterothallic system, compatible mating types conjugate and give rise to dikaryotic hyphae, usually with clamp connections. In many dimorphic basidiomycetes the dikaryotic hyphal state may be parasitic on either green plants or fungi. However, putative host associations have not been identified from any yeast taxa and their sexual states are only known from observations on culture media. Basidiomycetous yeasts predominantly form soft, often slimy, or mucoid colonies. The yeast state usually commences with basidiospore germination. In some Tremella species and in species of Mycogloea, basidial cells can occasionally bud directly The unicellular haploid state ends at the initiation of the dikaryotic state in those yeasts with known teleomorphs (i.e., following mating of compatible cells). However, development of hyphae and basidia from single haploid cells (i.e., self-fertile or monokaryotic fruiting) or fusion of same sex haploid cells occurs in some species, such as Filobasidiella neoformans.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter studies the genus Babjeviella. In the determination of asexual reproduction, cell division is by multilateral budding on a narrow base. Cells are short ellipsoid to elongate. Neither pseudohyphae nor true hyphae are formed. Colonies are butyrous with a glistening surface. In sexual reproduction, it is seen that Asci are unconjugated, and form one to four hat-shaped ascospores that are released by ascus deliquescence. Transmission electron microscopy has shown that bulb-like structures sometimes form on the brims of the ascospores. It is not known whether the species is homothallic or heterothallic. In physiology and biochemistry, it is seen that sugars are not fermented, but many of the sugars and polyols in standard yeast growth tests are assimilated. The major ubiquinone formed is CoQ-9, and the diazonium blue B test is negative. B. inositovora, the only known species in the genus, is one of only a few ascomycetous yeasts that can utilize myoinositol as a sole source of carbon. The type of species mentioned and accepted is Babjeviella inositovora. The systematic discussion of the species includes growth on 5\% malt extract agar, growth on the surface of assimilation media, Dalmau plate culture on morphology agar, formation of ascospores, fermentation, CoQ, Mol\% G1C, gene sequence accession numbers, type strain, cell carbohydrates, origin of the strains studied, type strain, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

Species of the teleomorph genera Galactomyces and Dipodascus and the anamorph genus Geotrichum, as recognized by de Hoog showed a bipartition on the basis of LSU rRNA as well as SSU rRNA gene sequence analysis. All Galactomyces species clustered in one group together with six Dipodascus species and two Geotrichum taxa, while the six remaining Dipodascus species and one Geotrichum species were far from this cluster. On the basis of ITS sequence analysis, de Hoog and Smith reclassified the latter teleomorph species in the genus Magnusiomyces and the anamorph taxa in the genus Saprochaete. From DNA reassociation data de Hoog and Smith accepted two more species in Galactomyces, Gal. candidus and Gal. pseudocandidus. The possible role of actin in the growth of the tip of a strain cited as Geo. candidum was examined by Heath. Strains labeled Geo. candidum were examined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis to determine their chromosomal make-up. Since themost commonly occurring species Gal. candidus/Geo. Candidum is beneficial as well as detrimental, Gente developed a molecular identification systemto separate this species fromthe species proposed by de Hoog and Smith.},

	abstract = {Abstract Aims: To study the yeast diversity of Nigerian palm wines by comparison with other African strains. Methods and Results: Twenty-three Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains were obtained from palm wine samples collected at four locations in eastern Nigeria, and characterized using different molecular techniques: internal transcribed spacer restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequence analysis, pulsed field gel electrophoresis, inter delta typing and microsatellite multilocus analysis. These techniques revealed that palm wine yeasts represent a group of closely related strains that includes other West African isolates (CBS400, NCYC110, DVPG6044). Population analysis revealed an excess of homozygote strains and an allelic richness similar to wine suggestive of local domestication. Several other African yeast strains were not connected to this group. Ghana sorghum beer strains and other African strains (DBVPG1853 and MUCL28071) displayed strikingly high relatedness with European bread, beer or wine strains, and the genome of strain MUCL30909 contained African and wine-type alleles, indicating its hybrid origin. Conclusions: Nigerian palm wine yeast represents a local specific yeast flora, whereas a European origin or hybrid was suspected for several other Africa isolates. Significance and Impact of the Study: This study presents the first genetic characterization of an autochthonous African palm wine yeast population and confirms the idea that human intervention has favoured yeast migration.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter studies the genus Schizoblastosporion. It provides a systematic discussion of the species and concludes with comments on the genus. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. Asexual reproduction is by bipolar budding in basipetal succession on a broad base. Fermentation is absent. Acetic acid is not produced. Nitrate is not assimilated. The diazonium blue B reaction is negative. Coenzyme Q-6 is produced. The anamorphic genus Schizoblastosporion exhibits bipolar budding in common with the anamorphic genus Kloeckera, as well as with the Teleomorphic genera Hanseniaspora, Nadsonia, Saccharomycodes, and Wickerhamia. Schizoblastosporion differs from other kloeckera by lack of fermentation and by absence of acetic acid production. Comparisons of D1/D2 LSU rRNA gene sequences have shown that S. starkeyi-henricii is an ananamorphic member of the Nadsonia clade. Kreger-vanRij and Veenhuis examined the process of bipolar budding in Schizoblastosporion and in species of Hanseniaspora, Nadsonia, Saccharomycodes, and Wickerhamia in a comparative electron microscopic study.},

Unexpectedly, the centromere appears to be the fastest-evolving part of the chromosome, evolving even faster than DNA sequences unlikely to be under selective constraint (i.e., synonymous sites after correcting for codon usage bias and remnant transposable elements). Centromeres on other chromosomes also show an elevated rate of nucleotide substitution. Rapid centromere evolution has also been reported for some plants and animals and has been attributed to selection for inclusion in the egg or the ovule at female meiosis. But Saccharomyces yeasts have symmetrical meioses with all four products surviving, thus providing no opportunity for meiotic drive. In addition, yeast centromeres show the high levels of polymorphism expected under a neutral model of molecular evolution. We suggest that yeast centromeres suffer an elevated rate of mutation relative to other chromosomal regions and they change through a process of "centromere drift," not drive.},

	abstract = {Plant microbiota (the microorganisms that live in any associations with plant tissues) represents a rather unexplored area of metagenomic research compared with soils and oceans. Constructing a metagenomic library for plant microbiota is technically challenging. Using all the biomass without pre-enrichment could lead to vast proportions of the host plant DNA in the metagenomic library, doubtless obliterating the microbial contribution. Therefore, the first and essential step is to enrich for the constituent microorganisms from plant tissues. Here, a strong enrichment for plant microbiota was achieved by coupling SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) with NaCl, creating a predominantly microbial metagenomic library that contains 88\% bacterial inserts. 16S rDNA sequence analysis revealed that the metagenomic DNA of enrichments originates from very diverse microorganisms. At least 74 distinct ribotypes (at a 97\% threshold) from seven different bacterial phyla were identified and mainly distributed among Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria. Additionally, a simplified version of Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) was developed for a quick and efficient assessment of the enriching procedures. This work opens further insight into the great biotechnical potential of plant microbiota, holding more potential for drug discovery through a metagenomic strategy, and paving the way for recovery and biochemical characterization of functional gene repertoire from plant microbiota.},

This chapter describes the use of some chemotaxonomic approaches used in yeast taxonomy. Its emphasis is placed on FA based lipids and their taxonomic value in yeasts. Emphasis is on cell wall carbohydrate composition, coenzyme Q, electrophoresis of enzymes, and the analysis of fatty acids. For each of these approaches, technical protocols are provided. Coenzyme Q plays a primary role as an essential component of the respiratory electron transport chain of the inner mitochondrial membranes of eukaryotes, and in the plasma membrane of prokaryotes. It is also found in other organelles, and in the plasma membrane of eukaryotes, where it participates in a plasma membrane electron transport system. Furthermore, multiple additional functions of CoQ have been observed. The natural CoQ series encompasses 2,3-dimethoxy-5-methyl-6-polyprenyl-1, 4-benzoquinone nucleus with side chains containing 1 to 12 isoprenoid units. A diverse variety of fungal lipid types occur, including compounds based on long-chain fatty acids (FAs) and those derived from isoprene units such as terpenoid lipids.},

The changes include gradual increases in gene number, resulting from the retention of duplicate genes, and more abrupt increases in the abundance of spliceosomal introns and mobile genetic elements. We argue that many of these modifications emerged passively in response to the long-term population-size reductions that accompanied increases in organism size. According to this model, much of the restructuring of eukaryotic genomes was initiated by nonadaptive processes, and this in turn provided novel substrates for the secondary evolution of phenotypic complexity by natural selection. The enormous long-term effective population sizes of prokaryotes may impose a substantial barrier to the evolution of complex genomes and morphologies.},

	abstract = {We developed interpolated climate surfaces for global land areas (excluding Antarctica) at a spatial resolution of 30 arc s (often referred to as 1-km spatial resolution). The climate elements considered were monthly precipitation and mean, minimum, and maximum temperature. Input data were gathered from a variety of sources and, where possible, were restricted to records from the 1950{\textendash}2000 period. We used the thin-plate smoothing spline algorithm implemented in the ANUSPLIN package for interpolation, using latitude, longitude, and elevation as independent variables. We quantified uncertainty arising from the input data and the interpolation by mapping weather station density, elevation bias in the weather stations, and elevation variation within grid cells and through data partitioning and cross validation. Elevation bias tended to be negative (stations lower than expected) at high latitudes but positive in the tropics. Uncertainty is highest in mountainous and in poorly sampled areas. Data partitioning showed high uncertainty of the surfaces on isolated islands, e.g. in the Pacific. Aggregating the elevation and climate data to 10 arc min resolution showed an enormous variation within grid cells, illustrating the value of high-resolution surfaces. A comparison with an existing data set at 10 arc min resolution showed overall agreement, but with significant variation in some regions. A comparison with two high-resolution data sets for the United States also identified areas with large local differences, particularly in mountainous areas. Compared to previous global climatologies, ours has the following advantages: the data are at a higher spatial resolution (400 times greater or more); more weather station records were used; improved elevation data were used; and more information about spatial patterns of uncertainty in the data is available. Owing to the overall low density of available climate stations, our surfaces do not capture of all variation that may occur at a resolution of 1 km, particularly of precipitation in mountainous areas. In future work, such variation might be captured through knowledge-based methods and inclusion of additional co-variates, particularly layers obtained through remote sensing.

This chapter focuses on the resolution of species using various types of DNA comparisons. DNA sequence analyses, and other DNA-based methodologies, have transformed the way in which yeasts are identified. DNA comparisons of yeasts have paralleled the increasing sophistication of methods for nucleic acid characterization in general. The chapter further involves the nuclear DNA reassociation that includes quantitation of the degree of gene sequence similarity between strains that became possible with the development of DNA reassociation techniques. These measure the extent of pairing of nucleotide sequences when DNA is made single-stranded, and then allowed to re-pair as a double strand. There are two basic methods. One is {\textquotedblleft}free solution,{\textquotedblright} in which both DNAs of the test pair react while dissolved in a buffer solution, and the second relies on binding of one of the pair as single-stranded DNA to a matrix, such as a nitrocellulose filter, while the other strand of DNA remains free in the buffer surrounding the bound DNA.},

Host plant family has the strongest effect on the phylogenetic community composition of fungi, whereas temperature and precipitation mostly affect EcM fungal richness that peaks in the temperate and boreal forest biomes, contrasting with latitudinal patterns of macro-organisms. Tropical ecosystems experience rapid turnover of organic material and have weak soil stratification, suggesting that poor habitat conditions may contribute to the relatively low richness of EcM fungi, and perhaps other soil biota, in most tropical ecosystems. For EcM fungi, greater evolutionary age and larger total area of EcM host vegetation may also contribute to the higher diversity in temperate ecosystems.

	abstract = {Integration of fungal evolution with the dates of plate tectonic movements, paleoecology, and the evolution of plants and animals requires a molecular clock. Imperfect though they may be, molecular clocks provide the means to convert molecular change into geological time. The relationships among clocks, phylogeography, fossils, and substitution rate variation, along with incorporation of uncertainty into clock estimates are the topics for this commentary. This commentary is timely because, for deeper divergences on the order of hundreds of millions of years, estimates of age of origin are benefiting from increasingly accurate organismal phylogenies and increasingly realistic models of molecular evolution. Taking advantage of Bayesian approaches permitting complex assumptions about node ages and molecular evolution, we used the program BEAST to apply a relaxed lognormal clock analysis to a data set comprising 50 loci for 26 taxa. In the resulting tree, branches associated with nodes calibrated by fossils showed more dramatic substitution rate variation than branches at nodes lacking calibration. As a logical extension of this result, we suspect that undetected rate variation in the uncalibrated parts of the tree is as dramatic as in the calibrated sections, underscoring the importance of fossil calibration. Fortunately, new and interesting fungal fossils are being discovered and we review some of the new discoveries that confirm the ancient origin of important taxa. To help evaluate which fossils might be useful for constraining the ages of nodes, we selected fossils thought to be early members of their clades and used ribosomal or protein-coding gene sequence substitution rates to calculate whether fossil age and expected lineage age coincide. Where ages of a fossil and the expected age of a lineage do coincide, the fossils will be particularly useful in constraining node ages in molecular clock analyses.},

	abstract = {Mutation is the underlying force that provides the variation upon which evolutionary forces can act. It is important to understand how mutation rates vary within genomes and how the probabilities of fixation of new mutations vary as well. If substitutional processes across the genome are heterogeneous, then examining patterns of coding sequence evolution without taking these underlying variations into account may be misleading. Here we present the first rigorous test of substitution rate heterogeneity in the Drosophila melanogaster genome using almost 1500 nonfunctional fragments of the transposable element DNAREP1\_DM. Not only do our analyses suggest that substitutional patterns in heterochromatic and euchromatic sequences are different, but also they provide support in favor of a recombination-associated substitutional bias toward G and C in this species. The magnitude of this bias is entirely sufficient to explain recombination-associated patterns of codon usage on the autosomes of the D. melanogaster genome. We also document a bias toward lower GC content in the pattern of small insertions and deletions (indels). In addition, the GC content of noncoding DNA in Drosophila is higher than would be predicted on the basis of the pattern of nucleotide substitutions and small indels. However, we argue that the fast turnover of noncoding sequences in Drosophila makes it difficult to assess the importance of the GC biases in nucleotide substitutions and small indels in shaping the base composition of noncoding sequences.},

Most of fitness variation was explained by the divergence of genetically distinct groups, distributed along a north{\textendash}south cline, suggesting that these groups have adapted to distinct climatic conditions. Within-group fitness components were correlated with climatic conditions, illustrating that even ubiquitous microorganisms locally adapt and harbour standing genetic variation for climate-related traits. Our results suggest that global climatic changes could lead to adaptation to new conditions within groups, or changes in their geographical distributions.},

This chapter discusses the genus Millerozyma. In the determination of the asexual reproduction, it is found that cell division is by multilateral budding on a narrow base. Cells are spherical to elongate. Pseudohyphae are formed, but true hyphae are absent. Colonies are butyrous in texture. In sexual reproduction it is seen that asci form following conjugation between a cell and its bud or, less commonly, between independent cells. Asci form one to four ascospores, which may be hat-shaped with a narrow brim or spherical to ovoid with a subequatorial ledge. Asci may be deliquescent or persistent. Known species are homothallic. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Millerozyma farinose. The key characters of species assigned to the genus Millerozyma are presented in this study. In the systematic discussion of the species, synonyms, growth on 5\% malt extract agar, growth on the surface of assimilation media, Dalmau plate culture on morphology agar, formation of ascospores, origin of the strains studied, systematics, ecology, and biotechnology are determined.},

This chapter studies the genus Kazachstania. Asexual reproduction is by multilateral budding on a narrow base. Cells are spherical, ovoid, or elongate. Pseudohyphae may be formed, but true hyphae are not produced. Colonies are smooth and white to tan in color. In sexual reproduction it is seen that asci may be unconjugated or show conjugation between independent cells or between a cell and its bud. Asci are persistent or deliquescent at maturity and produce 1{\textendash}16 spherical, ovoid, or reniform ascospores. Ascospore surfaces may be roughened or smooth. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that species are generally characterized by restricted responses to the standard tests used in yeast taxonomy. The chapter further examines the phylogenetic placement. The type of species mentioned is Kazachstania viticola.

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
The genus studied in this chapter is Xanthophyllomyces. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that cells are ellipsoidal, reproduce by enteroblastic budding, and occur singly, in pairs, and occasionally in short chains. Carotenoid pigments are synthesized (mainly astaxanthin and a minor proportion of $\beta$-carotene), which gives the colonies an orange to salmon-red color. In the sexual reproduction it is found that slender cylindrical holobasidia arise mainly after conjugation between a cell and its bud. Cell to cell conjugation, although rare, may take place. Basidiospores are produced terminally on minute pegs on an elongate holobasidium. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous. In the systematic discussion of the species growth on yeast morphology agar, growth in glucose{\textendash}yeast extract{\textendash}peptone water, slide cultures on corn meal agar, formation of basidiospores, origin of the strains studied, cell carbohydrates, and ecology are determined. The present view that Xanthophyllomyces is limited to one species is due to lack of information on the genetic variability within the genus and the difficulty of examining cross-strain mating studies, due to the primary cell/bud mode of sexual reproduction.},

	abstract = {We suggest hypotheses to account for two major features of chromosomal organization in higher eukaryotes. The first of these is the general restriction of crossing over in the neighborhood of centromeres and telomeres. We propose that this is a consequence of selection for reduced rates of unequal exchange between repeated DNA sequences for which the copy number is subject to stabilizing selection: microtubule binding sites, in the case of centromeres, and the short repeated sequences needed for terminal replication of a linear DNA molecule, in the case of telomeres. An association between proximal crossing over and nondisjunction would also favor the restriction of crossing over near the centromere. The second feature is the association between highly repeated DNA sequences of no obvious functional significance and regions of restricted crossing over. We show that highly repeated sequences are likely to persist longest (over evolutionary time) when crossing over is infrequent. This is because unequal exchange among repeated sequences generates single copy sequences, and a population that becomes fixed for a single copy sequence by drift remains in this state indefinitely (in the absence of gene amplification processes). Increased rates of exchange thus speed up the process of stochastic loss of repeated sequences.},

Its important role of spindle attachment to the kinetochore during meiosis and mitosis notwithstanding, recent studies implicate the centromere as an active player in chromosome evolution and the divergence of species. This is exemplified by centromeric involvement in translocations, fusions, inversions, and centric shifts. Often species are defined karyotypically simply by the position of the centromere on certain chromosomes. Little is known about how the centromere, either as a functioning unit of chromatin or as a specific block of repetitive DNA sequences, acts in the creation of these types of chromosome rearrangements in an evolutionary context. Macropodine marsupials (kangaroos and wallabies) offer unique insights into current theories expositing centromere emergence during karyotypic diversification and speciation.},

This chromosomal speciation hypothesis thus predicts more rapid genetic divergence on rearranged than on colinear chromosomes because the former are less porous to gene flow. A number of studies of fungi, plants, and animals, including limited genetic data of humans and chimpanzees, support the hypothesis. Here we reexamine the hypothesis for humans and chimpanzees with substantially more genomic data than were used previously. No difference is observed between rearranged and colinear chromosomes in the level of genomic DNA sequence divergence between species. The same is also true for protein sequences. When the gorilla is used as an outgroup, no acceleration in protein sequence evolution associated with chromosomal rearrangements is found. Furthermore, divergence in expression pattern between orthologous genes is not significantly different for rearranged and colinear chromosomes. These results, showing that chromosomal rearrangements did not affect the rate of genetic divergence between humans and chimpanzees, are expected if incipient species on the evolutionary lineages separating humans and chimpanzees did not hybridize.},

	abstract = {The claim that eukaryotic micro-organisms have global geographic ranges, constituting a significant departure from the situation with macro-organisms, has been supported by studies of morphological species from protistan kingdoms. Here, we examine this claim by reviewing examples from another kingdom of eukaryotic microbes, the Fungi. We show that inferred geographic range of a fungal species depends upon the method of species recognition. While some fungal species defined by morphology show global geographic ranges, when fungal species are defined by phylogenetic species recognition they are typically shown to harbour several to many endemic species. We advance two non-exclusive reasons to explain the perceived difference between the size of geographic ranges of microscopic and macroscopic eukaryotic species when morphological methods of species recognition are used. These reasons are that microbial organisms generally have fewer morphological characters, and that the rate of morphological change will be slower for organisms with less elaborate development and fewer cells. Both of these reasons result in fewer discriminatory morphological differences between recently diverged lineages. The rate of genetic change, moreover, is similar for both large and small organisms, which helps to explain why phylogenetic species of large and small organisms show a more similar distribution of geographic ranges. As a consequence of the different rates in fungi of genetic and morphological changes, genetic isolation precedes a recognizable morphological change. The final step in speciation, reproductive isolation, also follows genetic isolation and may precede morphological change.},

	abstract = {Microbes are the unseen majority in soil and comprise a large portion of life{\textquoteright}s genetic diversity. Despite their abundance, the impact of soil microbes on ecosystem processes is still poorly understood. Here we explore the various roles that soil microbes play in terrestrial ecosystems with special emphasis on their contribution to plant productivity and diversity. Soil microbes are important regulators of plant productivity, especially in nutrient poor ecosystems where plant symbionts are responsible for the acquisition of limiting nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria are responsible for c. 5{\textendash}20\% (grassland and savannah) to 80\% (temperate and boreal forests) of all nitrogen, and up to 75\% of phosphorus, that is acquired by plants annually. Free-living microbes also strongly regulate plant productivity, through the mineralization of, and competition for, nutrients that sustain plant productivity. Soil microbes, including microbial pathogens, are also important regulators of plant community dynamics and plant diversity, determining plant abundance and, in some cases, facilitating invasion by exotic plants. Conservative estimates suggest that c. 20~000 plant species are completely dependent on microbial symbionts for growth and survival pointing to the importance of soil microbes as regulators of plant species richness on Earth. Overall, this review shows that soil microbes must be considered as important drivers of plant diversity and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems.},

This chapter studies the genus Meira. In the determination of asexual reproduction it is found that colonies are dimorphic, with thin aerial mycelium made up of fusiform blastoconidia giving the colony a somewhat velvety appearance. Initial growth of cells is yeast-like with fusiform cells showing polar budding on an acropetal rachis. Septate hyphae are hyaline, usually with the cytoplasm retracted in some cells, which are separated by lysed cells. Clamp connections are absent. Sterigma-like outgrowths, frequently occurring near the septa, give rise to short chains of fusiform blastoconidia. This chapter also examines sexual reproduction, physiology, biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. The type species mentioned is Meira geulakonigii and the species accepted are Meira argovae and Meira geulakonigii. There are two keys to species: Nitrate is assimilated and not assimilated. The systematic discussion of the species includes growth on yeast extract peptone glucose agar, growth on the surface of 2\% glucose YNB medium, fermentation, CoQ, Mol\% G1C, gene sequence accession numbers, type strain, cell carbohydrates, origin of the strain studied, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

	abstract = {The majority of DNA in eukaryotic cells exists in the highly condensed structural hierarchy of chromatin, which presents a challenge to DNA repair enzymes in that recognition, incision, and restoration of the original sequence at most sites must take place within these structural constraints. To test base excision repair (BER) activities on chromatin substrates, an in vitro system was developed that uses human uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG), apyrimidinic/apurinic endonuclease (APE), and DNA polymerase beta (pol beta) on homogeneously damaged, rotationally positioned DNA in nucleosomes. We find that UDG and APE carry out their combined catalytic activities with reduced efficiency on nucleosome substrates ( approximately 10\% of that on naked DNA). Furthermore, these enzymes distinguish between two different rotational settings of the lesion on the histone surface, showing a 2- to 3-fold difference in activity between uracil facing "toward" and "away from" the histones. However, UDG and APE will digest such substrates to completion in a concentration-dependent manner. Conversely, the synthesis activity of pol beta is inhibited completely by nucleosome substrates and is independent of enzyme concentration. These results suggest that the first two steps of BER, UDG and APE, may occur "unassisted" in chromatin, whereas downstream factors in this pathway (i.e., pol beta) may require nucleosome remodeling for efficient DNA BER in at least some regions of chromatin in eukaryotic cells.},

In many eukaryotes, homologous chromosomes that fail to become linked by exchanges exhibit elevated levels of meiotic errors, but they do not segregate randomly, demonstrating that mechanisms beyond exchange can promote proper meiosis I segregation. The experiments described here demonstrate the existence of a meiotic centromere pairing mechanism in budding yeast. This centromere pairing mediates the meiosis I bipolar spindle attachment of nonexchange chromosome pairs and likely plays the same role for all homologous chromosome pairs.},

	abstract = {A fundamental goal in biology is to achieve a mechanistic understanding of how and to what extent ecological variation imposes selection for distinct traits and favors the fixation of specific genetic variants. Key to such an understanding is the detailed mapping of the natural genomic and phenomic space and a bridging of the gap that separates these worlds. Here we chart a high-resolution map of natural trait variation in one of the most important genetic model organisms, the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and its closest wild relatives and trace the genetic basis and timing of major phenotype changing events in its recent history. We show that natural trait variation in S. cerevisiae exceeds that of its relatives, despite limited genetic variation, and follows the population history rather than the source environment. In particular, the West African population is phenotypically unique, with an extreme abundance of low-performance alleles, notably a premature translational termination signal in GAL3 that cause inability to utilize galactose. Our observations suggest that many S. cerevisiae traits may be the consequence of genetic drift rather than selection, in line with the assumption that natural yeast lineages are remnants of recent population bottlenecks. Disconcertingly, the universal type strain S288C was found to be highly atypical, highlighting the danger of extrapolating gene-trait connections obtained in mosaic, lab-domesticated lineages to the species as a whole. Overall, this study represents a step towards an in-depth understanding of the causal relationship between co-variation in ecology, selection pressure, natural traits, molecular mechanism, and alleles in a key model organism.},

We need to understand these biases if we are to interpret the differences that have accumulated between species and individuals. Applications include estimating the time since evolutionary lineages diverged and detecting the signature of natural selection in DNA sequences. However, mutational biases have been obscured because, since mutations arose, natural selection has eliminated some whilst allowing others to persist to the present. We therefore study mutations that have accumulated in regions of the genome that are free from selection in a grasshopper with a gigantic genome. All other animal studies using this approach find an excess of mutations between DNA bases having similar biochemical properties (transitions rather than transversions). This bias has been widely interpreted as a consequence of the fundamental biochemical basis of mutation. However, once we exclude mutations associated with DNA methylation, we find no evidence of a transition bias, unlike the few comparable animal studies that make the same correction. We propose that this result indicates previously unanticipated differences between species in the selection on or mutation of their DNA.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}/sec{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae is one of the premier model systems for studying the genomics and evolution of transposable elements. The availability of the S. cerevisiae genome led to unprecedented insights into its five known transposable element families (the LTR retrotransposons Ty1-Ty5) in the years shortly after its completion. However, subsequent advances in bioinformatics tools for analysing transposable elements and the recent availability of genome sequences for multiple strains and species of yeast motivates new investigations into Ty evolution in S. cerevisiae. Here we provide a comprehensive phylogenetic and population genetic analysis of all Ty families in S. cerevisiae based on a systematic re-annotation of Ty elements in the S288c reference genome. We show that previous annotation efforts have underestimated the total copy number of Ty elements for all known families. In addition, we identify a new family of Ty3-like elements related to the S. paradoxus Ty3p which is composed entirely of degenerate solo LTRs. Phylogenetic analyses of LTR sequences identified three families with short-branch, recently active clades nested among long branch, inactive insertions (Ty1, Ty3, Ty4), one family with essentially all recently active elements (Ty2) and two families with only inactive elements (Ty3p and Ty5). Population genomic data from 38 additional strains of S. cerevisiae show that the majority of Ty insertions in the S288c reference genome are fixed in the species, with insertions in active clades being predominantly polymorphic and insertions in inactive clades being predominantly fixed. Finally, we use comparative genomic data to provide evidence that the Ty2 and Ty3p families have arisen in the S. cerevisiae genome by horizontal transfer. Our results demonstrate that the genome of a single individual contains important information about the state of TE population dynamics within a species and suggest that horizontal transfer may play an important role in shaping the genomic diversity of transposable elements in unicellular eukaryotes.},

This chapter discusses the genus Nakaseomyces. Cells are ovoid, ellipsoid, or elongate. Neither pseudohyphae nor true hyphae are produced. In sexual reproduction it is found that asci arise directly from diploid cells or from the conjugation of haploid cells in the same culture. Four or occasionally six to eight bacilliform or reniform ascospores are formed. The spores are liberated from the ascus and tend to agglutinate. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Nakaseomyces delphensis. The key characters of Nakaseomyces species are presented. In the systematic discussion of the species, synonyms, growth on YM agar, growth in glucose-yeast extract broth, Dalmau plate culture on corn meal agar, formation of ascospores, gene sequence accession number, type strain, origin of the strains studied, and systematics are determined.},

Previous studies were unable to provide a general answer because they used a single biodiversity index, were geographically restricted, compared areas of unequal size or did not quantitatively compare hotspot types. Here we use a new global database on the breeding distribution of all known extant bird species to test for congruence across three types of hotspot. We demonstrate that hotspots of species richness, threat and endemism do not show the same geographical distribution. Only 2.5\% of hotspot areas are common to all three aspects of diversity, with over 80\% of hotspots being idiosyncratic. More generally, there is a surprisingly low overall congruence of biodiversity indices, with any one index explaining less than 24\% of variation in the other indices. These results suggest that, even within a single taxonomic class, different mechanisms are responsible for the origin and maintenance of different aspects of diversity. Consequently, the different types of hotspots also vary greatly in their utility as conservation tools.},

	abstract = {Hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila is a syndrome of gonadal atrophy, sterility, and male recombination, and it occurs in the progeny of crosses between males that harbor certain transposable elements (TEs) and females that lack them. Known examples of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila melanogaster result from mobilization of individual families of TEs, such as the P element, the I element, or hobo. An example of hybrid dysgenesis in Drosophila virilis is unique in that multiple, unrelated families of TEs become mobilized, but a TE designated Penelope appears to play a major role. In all known examples of hybrid dysgenesis, the paternal germ line transmits the TEs in an active state, whereas the female germ line maintains repression of the TEs. The mechanism of maternal maintenance of repression is not known. Recent evidence suggests that the molecular machinery of RNA interference may function as an important host defense against TEs. This protection is mediated by the action of endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) composed of dsRNA molecules of 21-25 nt that can target complementary transcripts for destruction. In this paper, we demonstrate that endogenous siRNA derived from the Penelope element is maternally loaded in embryos through the female germ line in D. virilis. We also present evidence that the maternal inheritance of these endogenous siRNAs may contribute to maternal repression of Penelope.},

	abstract = {Theories regarding the evolution of spliceosomal introns differ in the extent to which the distribution of introns reflects either a formative role in the evolution of protein-coding genes or the adventitious gain of genetic elements. Here, systematic methods are used to assess the causes of the present-day distribution of introns in 10 families of eukaryotic protein-coding genes comprising 1,868 introns in 488 distinct alignment positions. The history of intron evolution inferred using a probabilistic model that allows ancestral inheritance of introns, gain of introns, and loss of introns reveals that the vast majority of introns in these eukaryotic gene families were not inherited from the most recent common ancestral genes, but were gained subsequently. Furthermore, among inferred events of intron gain that meet strict criteria of reliability, the distribution of sites of gain with respect to reading-frame phase shows a 5:3:2 ratio of phases 0, 1 and 2, respectively, and exhibits a nucleotide preference for MAG GT (positions -3 to +2 relative to the site of gain). The nucleotide preferences of intron gain may prove to be the ultimate cause for the phase bias. The phase bias of intron gain is sufficient to account quantitatively for the well-known 5:3:2 bias in phase frequencies among extant introns, a conclusion that holds even when taxonomic heterogeneity in phase patterns is considered. Thus, intron gain accounts for the vast majority of extant introns and for the bias toward phase 0 introns that previously was interpreted as evidence for ancient formative introns.},

This chapter studies the genus Tilletiopsis. In the asexual reproduction colonies are cream colored, pinkish-cream, pinkish-yellow, yellow-brown, or brown, tough, and brittle to soft. Hyphae are regularly branched, narrow, septate, hyaline, and monokaryotic, with retraction septa, and cytoplasm-containing cells are usually surrounded by lysed cells. Clamp connections are absent. Septal pores are micropore-like. Ballistoconidia are bilaterally symmetrical, allantoid, falcate, or cylindrical and form on sterigmata. Chlamydospores may be present and are hyaline or pigmented. Sexual reproduction is unknown but chlamydospore-like structures of T. pallescens germinated with a holobasidium-like structure that forms ballistospores on the apex. It has been suggested that this structure represents the sexual state ballistospores on the apex. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Tilletiopsis washingtonensis. The key characters of species in the genus Tilletiopsis (T.) and Tilletiaria anomala are presented.

A disproportionate amount of past work has focused on distribution only, either documenting historical range shifts or predicting future occurrence patterns. However, simultaneous predictions of abundance and distribution across landscapes would be far more useful. To critically assess which approaches represent advances towards the goal of joint predictions of abundance and distribution, we review recent work on changing distributions and on effects of environmental drivers on single populations. Several methods have been used to predict changing distributions. Some of these can be easily modified to also predict abundance, but others cannot. In parallel, demographers have developed a much better understanding of how changing abiotic and biotic drivers will influence growth rate and abundance in single populations. However, this demographic work has rarely taken a landscape perspective and has largely ignored the effects of intraspecific density. We advocate a synthetic approach in which population models accounting for both density dependence and effects of environmental drivers are used to make integrated predictions of equilibrium abundance and distribution across entire landscapes. Such predictions would constitute an important step forward in assessing the ecological consequences of environmental changes.},

In this study, we analyzed 1110 samples obtained from the hollows of trees, shrubs and avian droppings at 8 geographical sites in and around Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. A total of 88 positive yeast strains were isolated and identified belonging to 20 yeast species. Despite the relative proximity of the sampling sites, our DNA fingerprinting results showed that the yeast populations were highly heterogenous. Among the 14 tree species sampled, cedar, cottonwood and basswood hollows had relatively high yeast colonization rates. Interestingly, Candida parapsilosis was isolated almost exclusively from Pine trees only. Our results are consistent with microgeographic and ecological differentiation of yeast species in and around an urban environment.},

Here, we use geospatial analytics to examine the degree to which the hydrologic connectivity of landscapes influences the transport of passively dispersed microbes, using the invasive plant pathogen Phytophthora ramorum as a case study. Pathogen occurrence was analyzed at 280 stream baiting stations across a range of watersheds {\textendash} exposed to variable inoculum pressure {\textendash} in California over a 7-year period (2004{\textendash}2010). Using logistic regression, we modeled the probability of pathogen occurrence at a baiting station based on nine environmental variables. We developed a novel geospatial approach to quantify the hydrologic connectivity of host vegetation and inoculum pressure derived from least cost distance analyses in each watershed. We also examined the influence of local environmental conditions within the immediate neighborhood of a baiting station. Over the course of the sampling period, the pathogen was detected at 67 baiting stations associated with coastal watersheds with mild climate conditions, steep slopes, and higher levels of inoculum pressure. At the watershed scale, hydrologic landscape connectivity was a key predictor of pathogen occurrence in streams after accounting for variation in climate and exposure to inoculum. This study illustrates a geospatial approach to modeling the degree to which hydrologic systems play a role in shaping landscape structures conducive for the transport of passively dispersed microbes in heterogeneous watersheds.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the genus Chionosphaera. It provides a systematic discussion of the species. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. Asexual reproduction in two species of the genus, C. apobasidialis and C. cuniculicola, is by bipolar budding of ellipsoid to sausage-shaped cells. Asexual reproduction in C. lichenicola, C. copinsii, and C. phylacicola is unknown. Hyphae are formed in C. cuniculicola, and dikaryotic hyphae are formed in self-fertile isolates of C. apobasidialis. In sexual reproduction basidiocarps are white, minute, stipitate-capitate, and occur abundantly on the natural substrate. The stipes are composed of bundles of parallel, infrequently septate hyphae with or without clamp connections. Caps of the basidiocarps are often waxy but sometimes cottony, globose to slightly flattened, and without hyphidia or other sterile elements. Hyphal septa attenuate toward a central pore. Basidia are clavate or tubular, terminal, and usually formed on unilaterally proliferating hyphal branches. Four to eight one-celled basidiospores are formed in tight apical clusters on short sterigmata. Basidiospores are hyaline, oblong to reniform, or ellipsoid to cylindrical and smooth. After the basidiospores are released, the basidial apex is crown-like, due to the presence of plugged short sterigmata.},

Cells are apiculate, ovoid to long-ovoid, or elongate. Pseudohyphae may be present, usually rudimentary and rarely well-developed. Colonies are smooth and cream in color. In sexual reproduction it is found that the ascospores are not produced. Ascosporic species are assigned to the teleomorph genus Hanseniaspora. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which glucose is fermented and nitrate is not assimilated. Myo-Inositol and pantothenate are required for growth. Acetic acid is not produced, coenzyme Q contains six isoprene units, and the diazonium blue B reaction is negative. The type species taken is Kloeckera apiculata. The six anamorphic Kloeckera species with six teleomorphic species in Hanseniaspora from comparisons of DNA homology are correlated.},

	abstract = {The advent of nucleic acid-based molecular methods, in particular the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), has revolutionised the study of soil microbial ecology, previously constrained by an inability to culture the majority of cells detected by direct microscopic observation. Extraction of DNA and RNA directly from cells in soil circumvents the requirement to grow microorganisms in laboratory culture, avoiding problems associated with the differential growth rates of the estimated 1\% that can be grown routinely. However, not all cells that contain DNA are capable of growth, and in some conditions such as air-dried soil, DNA can be extracted from non-viable microorganisms after 140 years of storage. To investigate the active microbial community, RNA can also be isolated directly from soil. Analysis of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) indicates the dominant active population in any particular set of conditions and the large, constantly increasing electronic database of gene sequences for the small subunit of rRNA (16S for prokaryotes, 18S for eukaryotes) provides identification of many soil bacteria, archaea and fungi with varying degrees of certainty to the genus, species or sub-species level. More precise information on which functional genes are active can be obtained from messenger RNA (mRNA). Newer methods including high-throughput (massively parallel) sequencing and microarrays offer further advances. We describe a range of molecular techniques used to investigate soil microbial communities, discuss how they relate to other methods for investigating bacterial and fungal activity, and explore their drawbacks and limitations.},

	abstract = {A panel of 15 human BAC/PAC probes, covering the entire chromosome 6, was used in FISH experiments on great apes and on representatives of Old World monkeys, New World monkeys, and lemurs to delineate the chromosome 6 phylogeny in primates. The domestic cat was used as an outgroup. The analysis showed a high marker order conservation, with few rearrangements required to reconcile the hypothesized chromosome 6 organization in primate ancestor with marker arrangement in all the examined species. Contrary to this simple evolutionary scenario, however, the centromere was found to be located in three distinct regions, without any evidence of chromosomal rearrangement that would account for its movement. One of the two centromere repositioning events occurred in great apes ancestor. The centromere moved from 6p22.1 to the present day location after the inversion event that differentiated marker order of the primate ancestor from the ancestor of Catarrhini. A cluster of intrachromosomal segmental duplications was found at 6p22.1, scattered in a region of about 9 Mb, which we interpret as remains of duplicons that flanked the ancestral centromere. Our data, therefore, suggest that some duplicon clusters found in noncentromeric/nontelomeric locations may represent traces of evolutionary silenced centromeres that inactivated after the occurrence of a centromere repositioning. In addition, the neocentromere emergence we have documented in Old World monkeys at 6q24.3 appears to have arisen and progressed without affecting the displaced flanking sequences.},

	abstract = {Assortative mating, when individuals of similar phenotypes mate, likely plays a key role in preventing gene flow during speciation. Reinforcement occurs when two previously geographically separated (allopatric) groups meet after having evolved partial postzygotic isolation; they are selected to evolve or enhance assortative mating to prevent costly intergroup matings that produce only maladaptive or sterile hybrids . Studies in Drosophila have shown that the genetic architectures of mating discrimination could differ significantly with or without reinforcement , suggesting that the evolution of assortative mating may be more complicated than expected. To study the evolution of assortative mating, we evolved mating discrimination in populations of the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae. After 36 cycles of selection, these cells are five times more likely to mate with each other than to their ancestors, despite detectable one-way gene flow between the selected and reference populations. Several individual cultures evolved mating discrimination by changing their mating kinetics, with some mating more rapidly and others more slowly than the ancestral population. Genetic analysis indicates that multiple mutations have accumulated to produce the altered mating preference. Our results show that subtle details of mating behavior can play an important role in the evolution of reproductive isolation.},

ORFeome annotation involves iterative computational predictions from genome sequences combined with experimental verifications. Here we re-examine a set of Saccharomyces cerevisiae "orphan" ORFs recently removed from the original ORFeome annotation due to lack of conservation across evolutionarily related yeast species. We show that many orphan ORFs produce detectable transcripts and/or translated products in various functional genomics and proteomics experiments. Combining a naive Bayes model that predicts the likelihood of an ORF to encode a functional product with experimental verification of strand-specific transcripts, we argue that orphan ORFs should remain as candidates for functional ORFs. In support of this model, inter-strain intra-species genome sequence variation is lower across orphan ORFs than in intergenic regions, indicating that orphan ORFs endure functional constraints and resist deleterious mutations. We conclude that ORFs should be evaluated based on multiple levels of evidence and not be removed from ORFeome annotation solely based on low sequence conservation in other species. Rather, such ORFs might be important for micro-evolutionary divergence between species. 10.1101/gr.076661.108},

Budding cells are present, and budding is frequently unipolar or bipolar. Cells are globose, ovoid, ellipsoidal, or cylindrical. Giant cells with thickened cell walls may be present in old cultures. Pseudohyphae may be formed. Cell walls are two-layered. Budding has been considered either holoblastic or enteroblastic; percurrent or sympodial elongation may occur, giving rise to distinct protrusions reminiscent of those found commonly in basidiomycetous yeasts. Colonies are cream, yellowish, or pinkish-cream but may become more intensely pink, orange, or tan upon aging. In sexual reproduction it is found that the filamentous states only form on host plants and give rise to asci that are primarily clavate to cylindrical and occur in a subcuticular palisade layer or are formed as terminal cells of the septate intercellular or subcuticular dikaryotic hyphae. In some species asci arise from more or less thick-walled ascogenous cells. In those cases a septum may form across the basal portion of the developing ascogenous cell, giving rise to the so-called stalk cell at the base of the ascus. Eight spherical, ovoid, ellipsoidal, or fusiform ascospores are formed and often bud inside the ascus, which becomes filled with smaller blastospores. Rupturing of the unitunicate ascus wall at the apex forcibly ejects ascospores and the entire content of the ascus is discharged as a single projectile. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Taphrina populina.},

This chapter discusses the genus Mixia. It provides a systematic discussion of the species and concludes with comments on the genus. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. In asexual reproduction colonies on corn meal agar (KM-30) are white to cream and become pale pinkish-cream upon age. Cells are oblong, cylindrical to pyriform, and reproduce mainly by enteroblastic budding. The cell wall is multilayered. Hyphae or pseudohyphae are not formed. Ballistoconidia do not occur. In sexual reproduction basidiospores are not observed to occur in pure culture. However, putative sexual spores are produced exogenously, enteroblastically, and simultaneously from sporogenous cells on the surface of the host plant, namely, fronds of the fern Osmunda japonica. Diagnosis on the basis of physiology and biochemistry reveals that fermentation is absent. Soluble starch is weakly assimilated. Extracellular starch-like compounds are not formed. Nitrate is not assimilated. Carotenoid pigments are formed. Staining with diazonium blue B is negative, but the colony turns yellowish. Urease activity is present. The major ubiquinone system is Q-10.},

We investigated the pattern of utilization of carbon substrates in wild populations of budding yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus. All isolates grew well on a core diet of about 10 substrates, and most were also able to grow on a much larger ancillary diet comprising most of the 190 substrates we tested. There was substantial genetic variation within each population for some substrates. We found geographical variation of substrate use at continental, regional, and local scales. Isolates from Europe and North America could be distinguished on the basis of the pattern of yield across substrates. Two geographical races at the North American sites also differed in the pattern of substrate utilization. Substrate utilization patterns were also geographically correlated at local spatial scales. Pairwise genetic correlations between substrates were predominantly positive, reflecting overall variation in metabolic performance, but there was a consistent negative correlation between categories of substrates in two cases: between the core diet and the ancillary diet, and between pentose and hexose sugars. Such negative correlations in the utilization of substrate from different categories may indicate either intrinsic physiological trade-offs for the uptake and utilization of substrates from different categories, or the accumulation of conditionally neutral mutations. Divergence in substrate use accompanies genetic divergence at all spatial scales in S.~paradoxus and may contribute to race formation and speciation.},

Repopulated strains exhibited alterations in chromosome size that were associated with Ty1 insertions, but did not become genetically isolated. The rates of element gain and loss under genetic and environmental conditions known to affect Ty1 retrotransposition were determined using genetically tagged reference elements. The results show that Ty1 retrotransposition varies with copy number, temperature, and cell type. In contrast to retrotransposition, Ty1 loss by LTR-LTR recombination was more constant and not markedly influenced by copy number. Endogenous Ty1 cDNA was poorly utilized for recombination when compared with LTR-LTR recombination or ectopic gene conversion. Ty1 elements also appear to be more susceptible to copy number fluctuation in haploid cells. Ty1 gain/loss ratios obtained under different conditions suggest that copy number oscillates over time by altering the rate of retrotransposition, resulting in the diverse copy numbers observed in Saccharomyces.},

This chapter studies the genus Kodamaea. In the determination of asexual reproduction, budding is multilateral on a narrow base, and some species form buds at the end of a short protuberance. The cells range from ellipsoidal to elongate. Pseudohyphae and true hyphae may be formed. In sexual reproduction it is seen that asci arise by transformation of diploid cells or by conjugation of independent cells. One member of the conjugated pair is usually cylindrical and the other swells and contains one to four hat-shaped or globose ascospores. Ascospores may be released by deliquescence of the ascus. This study further examines the physiology, biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. The type of species mentioned is Kodamaea ohmeri. The species accepted are Kodamaea anthophila, Kodamaea kakaduensis, Kodamaea laetipori, Kodamaea nitidulidarum, and Kodamaea ohmeri. The systematic discussion of the species includes growth on YM agar, growth in glucose-yeast extract broth, Dalmau plate culture on corn meal agar, formation of ascospores, CoQ, Mol\% G1C, gene sequence accession number, type strain, cell carbohydrates, origin of the strains studied, complementary mating types, systematics, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

Evolutionary geneticists have expended tremendous effort to estimate the genome-wide rate of mutation and the effects of new mutations on fitness, but the degree to which genomic mutational properties vary within and between taxa is largely unknown, particularly in multicellular organisms. Beginning with two highly inbred strains from each of three species in the nematode family Rhabditidae (Caenorhabditis briggsae, Caenorhabditis elegans, and Oscheius myriophila), we allowed mutations to accumulate in the relative absence of natural selection for 200 generations. We document significant variation in the rate of decay of fitness because of new mutations between strains and between species. Estimates of the per-generation mutational decay of fitness were very consistent within strains between assays 100 generations apart. Rate of mutational decay in fitness was positively associated with genomic mutation rate and negatively associated with average mutational effect. These results provide unambiguous experimental evidence for substantial variation in genome-wide properties of mutation both within and between species and reinforce conclusions from previous experiments that the cumulative effects on fitness of new mutations can differ markedly among related taxa.},

Yeasts can be defined as those fungi whose asexual growth predominantly results from budding or fission, and which do not form their sexual states within or upon a fruiting body. An imprecise distinction is made between yeasts and those dimorphic filamentous fungi that often produce abundant yeast-like growth. For ascomycetous yeasts, this distinction is substantiated by molecular comparisons, which demonstrate that budding and fission yeasts are phylogenetically distinct from one another and from the euascomycetes. Yeasts, whether ascomycetes or basidiomycetes, have sexual states that are not enclosed in fruiting bodies. Rules for taxonomy of the yeasts and other fungi fall under the authority of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature. From gene sequence comparisons, strains that represent new species are usually easily recognized. Nonetheless, some would argue against description of a new species based on a single strain. The argument is that a single strain does not reflect the genetic variation that might be found in a species, and that little can be learned of the ecology of a species when only a single strain is available.},

	abstract = {Saccharomyces cerevisiae is predominantly found in association with human activities, particularly the production of alcoholic beverages. S. paradoxus, the closest known relative of S. cerevisiae, is commonly found on exudates and bark of deciduous trees and in associated soils. This has lead to the idea that S. cerevisiae is a domesticated species, specialized for the fermentation of alcoholic beverages, and isolates of S. cerevisiae from other sources simply represent migrants from these fermentations. We have surveyed DNA sequence diversity at five loci in 81 strains of S. cerevisiae that were isolated from a variety of human and natural fermentations as well as sources unrelated to alcoholic beverage production, such as tree exudates and immunocompromised patients. Diversity within vineyard strains and within sak{\'e} strains is low, consistent with their status as domesticated stocks. The oldest lineages and the majority of variation are found in strains from sources unrelated to wine production. We propose a model whereby two specialized breeds of S. cerevisiae have been created, one for the production of grape wine and one for the production of sak{\'e} wine. We estimate that these two breeds have remained isolated from one another for thousands of years, consistent with the earliest archeological evidence for winemaking. We conclude that although there are clearly strains of S. cerevisiae specialized for the production of alcoholic beverages, these have been derived from natural populations unassociated with alcoholic beverage production, rather than the opposite.},

The availability of complete genome sequences for several organisms has seen the adoption of microarray technology to construct molecular phylogenies of bacteria, based on all of the genes. Similar techniques have been used to reveal the relationships between different strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have exploited microarray technology to construct a molecular phylogeny for the Saccharomyces sensu stricto complex of yeast species, which is based on all of the protein-encoding genes revealed by the complete genome sequence of the paradigmatic species, S. cerevisiae. We also analyze different strains of S. cerevisiae itself, as well as the putative species S. boulardii. We show that in addition to the phylogeny produced, we can identify and analyze individual ORF traits and interpret the results to give a detailed explanation of evolutionary events underlying the phylogeny.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although their role in cell division is essential, centromeres evolve rapidly in animals, plants and yeasts. Unlike the complex centromeres of plants and aminals, the point centromeres of Saccharomcyes yeasts can be readily sequenced to distinguish amongst the possible explanations for fast centromere evolution. RESULTS: Using DNA sequences of all 16 centromeres from 34 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and population genomic data from Saccharomyces paradoxus, I show that centromeres in both species evolve 3 times more rapidly even than selectively unconstrained DNA. Exceptionally high levels of polymorphism seen in multiple yeast populations suggest that rapid centromere evolution does not result from the repeated selective sweeps expected under meiotic drive. I further show that there is little evidence for crossing-over or gene conversion within centromeres, although there is clear evidence for recombination in their immediate vicinity. Finally I show that the mutation spectrum at centromeres is consistent with the pattern of spontaneous mutation elsewhere in the genome. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that rapid centromere evolution is a common phenomenon in yeast species. Furthermore, these results suggest that rapid centromere evolution does not result from the mutagenic effect of gene conversion, but from a generalised increase in the mutation rate, perhaps arising from the unusual chromatin structure at centromeres in yeast and other eukaryotes.},

	abstract = {Soil microbial communities contain the highest level of prokaryotic diversity of any environment, and metagenomic approaches involving the extraction of DNA from soil can improve our access to these communities. Most analyses of soil biodiversity and function assume that the DNA extracted represents the microbial community in the soil, but subsequent interpretations are limited by the DNA recovered from the soil. Unfortunately, extraction methods do not provide a uniform and unbiased subsample of metagenomic DNA, and as a consequence, accurate species distributions cannot be determined. Moreover, any bias will propagate errors in estimations of overall microbial diversity and may exclude some microbial classes from study and exploitation. To improve metagenomic approaches, investigate DNA extraction biases, and provide tools for assessing the relative abundances of different groups, we explored the biodiversity of the accessible community DNA by fractioning the metagenomic DNA as a function of (i) vertical soil sampling, (ii) density gradients (cell separation), (iii) cell lysis stringency, and (iv) DNA fragment size distribution. Each fraction had a unique genetic diversity, with different predominant and rare species (based on ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis [RISA] fingerprinting and phylochips). All fractions contributed to the number of bacterial groups uncovered in the metagenome, thus increasing the DNA pool for further applications. Indeed, we were able to access a more genetically diverse proportion of the metagenome (a gain of more than 80\% compared to the best single extraction method), limit the predominance of a few genomes, and increase the species richness per sequencing effort. This work stresses the difference between extracted DNA pools and the currently inaccessible complete soil metagenome.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter studies the genus Dekkera. In the determination of asexual reproduction, cells reproduce by multilateral budding and are spherical, subglobose to ellipsoidal, frequently with an ogival shape, or cylindrical to elongate. Pseudohyphae and branched, one-celled, nonseptate hyphae are sometimes formed. Cultures grow slowly and are generally short-lived because of acetic acid production. In sexual reproduction it is seen that asci arise without conjugation, are evanescent, and form one to four ascospores. Ascospores are hat-shaped or somewhat spherical with tangential brims and tend to agglutinate when released. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that cultures grow slowly and are usually short-lived. Acetic acid is produced aerobically from glucose. Fermentation is usually stimulated by molecular oxygen (Crabtree effect). Thiamine and biotin are required as extraneous vitamins. Coenzyme Q-9 is present. The diazonium blue B reaction is negative. The chapter further examines the phylogenetic placement where Dekkera and its anamorphic genus Brettanomyces appear to be neighboring genera of Saturnispora and Pichia. The type of species mentioned is Dekkera bruxellensis. The species accepted are Dekkera anomala and Dekkera bruxellensis. The systematic discussion of the species includes synonyms, growth in malt extract, growth on malt agar 12\% calcium carbonate, Dalmau plate cultures on potato, rice and morphology agars, formation of ascospores, CoQ, Mol\% G1C, gene sequence accession numbers, type strain, cell carbohydrates, origin of the strains studied, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

However, our understanding of the processes that generate new microbial species remains limited [1] despite the large contribution of microbes to the world's biodiversity. A recent hypothesis claims that microbes lack biogeographical divergence because their population sizes are large and their migration rates are presumably high [2, 3]. In recapitulating the classic microbial-ecology dictum that "everything is everywhere, and the environment selects"[4, 5], this hypothesis casts doubt on whether geographic divergence promotes speciation in microbes. To date, its predictions have been tested primarily with data from eubacteria and archaebacteria [6-8]. However, this hypothesis's most important implication is in sexual eukaryotic microbes, where migration and genetic admixture are specifically predicted to inhibit allopatric divergence and speciation [9]. Here, we use nuclear-sequence data from globally distributed natural populations of the yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus to investigate the role of geography in generating diversity in sexual eukaryotic microbes. We show that these populations have undergone allopatric divergence and then secondary contact without genetic admixture. Our data thus support the occurrence of evolutionary processes necessary for allopatric speciation in sexual microbes.},

To gain insight into the origin of the genomic isochores, we develop a maximum-likelihood approach to determine the history of substitution patterns in the human genome. This approach utilizes the vast amount of repetitive sequence deposited in the human genome over the past approximately 250 Myr. Using this approach, we estimate the frequencies of seven types of substitutions: the four transversions, two transitions, and the methyl-assisted transition of cytosine in CpG. Comparing substitutional patterns in repetitive elements of various ages, we reconstruct the history of the base-substitutional process in the different isochores for the past 250 Myr. At around 90 MYA (around the time of the mammalian radiation), we find an abrupt fourfold to eightfold increase of the cytosine transition rate in CpG pairs compared with that of the reptilian ancestor. Further analysis of nucleotide substitutions in regions with different GC content reveals concurrent changes in the substitutional patterns. Although the substitutional pattern was dependent on the regional GC content in such ways that it preserved the regional GC content before the mammalian radiation, it lost this dependence afterward. The substitutional pattern changed from an isochore-preserving to an isochore-degrading one. We conclude that isochores have been established before the radiation of the eutherian mammals and have been subject to the process of homogenization since then.},

In this study we found that two soil bacteria, Agrobacterium tumefaciens and Pseudomonas fluorescens, can undergo transformation in soil microcosms without any specific physical or chemical treatment. Moreover, P. fluorescens produced transformants in both sterile and nonsterile soil microcosms but failed to do so in the various in vitro conditions we tested. A. tumefaciens could be transformed in vitro and in sterile soil samples. These results indicate that the number of transformable bacteria could be higher than previously thought and that these bacteria could find the conditions necessary for uptake of extracellular DNA in soil.},

	abstract = {Assuming that patterns of sequence variants within highly homogeneous centromeric tandem repeat arrays can tell us which molecular turnover mechanisms are presently at work, we analyzed the alpha-satellite tandem repeat array DXZ1 of one human X chromosome. Here we present accurate snapshots from this dark matter of the genome. We demonstrate stable and representative cloning of the array in a P1 artificial chromosome (PAC) library, use samples of higher-order repeats subcloned from five unmapped PACs (120-160 kb) to identify common variants, and show that such variants are presently in a fixed transition state. To characterize patterns of variant spread throughout homogeneous array segments, we use a novel partial restriction and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis mapping approach. We find an older large-scale (35-50 kb) duplication event supporting the evolutionarily important unequal crossing-over hypothesis, but generally find independent variant occurrence and a paucity of potential de novo mutations within segments of highest homogeneity (99.1\%-99.3\%). Within such segments, a highly nonrandom variant clustering within adjacent higher-order repeats was found in the absence of haplotypic repeats. Such variant clusters are hardly explained by interchromosomal, fixation-driving mechanisms and likely reflect a fast, localized, intrachromosomal sequence conversion mechanism.},

	abstract = {The sex chromosomes and autosomes spend different times in the germ line of the two sexes. If cell division is mutagenic and if the sexes differ in number of cell divisions, then we expect that sequences on the X and Y chromosomes and autosomes should mutate at different rates. Tests of this hypothesis for several mammalian species have led to conflicting results. At the same time, recent evidence suggests that the chromosomal location of genes on autosomes affects their rate of evolution at synonymous sites. This suggests a mutagenic source different from germ cell replication. To correctly interpret the previous estimates of male mutation bias, it is crucial to understand the degree and range of this local similarity. With a carefully chosen randomization protocol, local similarity in synonymous rates of evolution can be detected in human-rodent and mouse-rat comparisons. However, the synonymous-site similarity in the mouse-rat comparison remains weak. Simulations suggest that this difference between the mouse-human and the mouse-rat comparisons is not artifactual and that there is therefore a difference between humans and rodents in the local patterns of mutation or selection on synonymous sites (conversely, we show that the previously reported absence of a local similarity in nonsynonymous rates of evolution in the human-rodent comparison was a methodological artifact). We show that linkage effects have a long-range component: not one in a million random genomes shows such levels of autosomal heterogeneity. The heterogeneity is so great that more autosomes than expected by chance have rates of synonymous evolution comparable with that of the X chromosome. As autosomal heterogeneity cannot be owing to different times spent in the germ line, this demonstrates that the dominant determiner of synonymous rates of evolution is not, as has been conjectured, the time spent in the male germ line.},

This chapter studies the genus Myxozyma. In the asexual reproduction cells divide by multilateral budding on a narrow base and are spherical or ellipsoidal. Poorly developed pseudohyphae may be present, but true hyphae are not formed. In sexual reproduction it is found that Myxozyma is the anamorphic state of the genus Lipomyces. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which sugars are not fermented, nitrate is not assimilated, cultures are often mucoid, and extracellular starch-like compounds are produced. The diazonium blue B reaction is negative and nearly all known species produce coenzyme Q-8, but two species form coenzyme Q-9. The type species taken is Myxozyma melibiosi. The genus Myxozyma was described for anamorphic ascomycetous yeasts with physiological and cultural properties similar to Lipomyces, i.e., formation of extracellular starch-like compounds and growth on imidazol and imidazol-4-carboxylic acid as sole sources of nitrogen.},

Estimated silent nucleotide diversity was similar in both populations (\{pi\} = 0.016, for the total sample). Nucleotide variation revealed an unusual haplotype structure showing a subset of 11 sequences with a single polymorphism. This haplotype was present at intermediate frequencies in both the European and the African samples. The presence of such a major haplotype in a highly recombining region is incompatible with the neutral equilibrium model. This haplotype structure in both a derived and a putatively ancestral population can be most parsimoniously explained by positive selection.

This chapter studies the genus Kregervanrija. In the determination of asexual reproduction, yeast cells arise by multilateral budding on a narrow base. Cells are globose, ovoid, or elongate. Pseudohyphae, if present, are not well differentiated. Septate hyphae are not formed. In sexual reproduction it is seen that asci are unconjugated or arise from conjugation between independent cells or between a cell and its bud. Asci form one to four ascospores and may be persistent or deliquescent. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that species do not ferment sugars, or do so only weakly. This study further examines the phylogenetic placement. The type of species mentioned is Kregervanrija fluxuum. The species accepted are Kregervanrija delftensis, Kregervanrija fluxuum, and Kregervanrija pseudodelftensis. The systematic discussion of the species includes growth on 5\% malt extract agar, growth on the surface of assimilation media, Dalmau plate culture on morphology agar, formation of ascospores, origin of the strains studied, authentic strain, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

This chapter discusses the genus Trigonopsis. It provides a systematic discussion of the species and concludes with comments on the genus. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. In asexual reproduction cells are divided by multilateral budding on a narrow base and are spherical, ellipsoidal, elongate, or triangular. Pseudohyphae may be present, but true hyphae are not formed. Glucose is fermented by some species, but other sugars are not fermented. Relatively few sugars are assimilated, and nitrate is not utilized as a sole source of nitrogen. Where determined, the ubiquinone formed is CoQ-9. The diazonium blue B reaction is negative. Trigonopsis variabilis is morphologically unique because the species produces triangular as well as ellipsoidal cells. The proportion of triangular cells varies among strains and is also affected by composition of the culture medium. Relatively few strains of the four known Trigonopsis species are available, but nearly all are from grapes or grape must, and a few are from beer. Consequently, this suggests that Trigonopsis may have a distinct ecological niche that is linked to grapes.},

The demographic history of our species is reflected in patterns of genetic variation within and among populations. We developed an efficient method for calculating the expected distribution of genetic variation, given a demographic model including such events as population size changes, population splits and joins, and migration. We applied our approach to publicly available human sequencing data, searching for models that best reproduce the observed patterns. Our joint analysis of data from African, European, and Asian populations yielded new dates for when these populations diverged. In particular, we found that African and Eurasian populations diverged around 100,000 years ago. This is earlier than other genetic studies suggest, because our model includes the effects of migration, which we found to be important for reproducing observed patterns of variation in the data. We also analyzed data from European, Asian, and Mexican populations to model the peopling of the Americas. Here, we find no evidence for recurrent migration after East Asian and Native American populations diverged. Our methods are not limited to studying humans, and we hope that future sequencing projects will offer more insights into the history of both our own species and others.},

An understanding of soil microbial ecology is central to our ability to assess terrestrial carbon cycle{\textendash}climate feedbacks, but the complexity of the soil microbial community and the many ways that it can be affected by climate and other global changes hampers our ability to draw firm conclusions on this topic. In this paper, we argue that to understand the potential negative and positive contributions of soil microbes to land{\textendash}atmosphere carbon exchange and global warming requires explicit consideration of both direct and indirect impacts of climate change on microorganisms. Moreover, we argue that this requires consideration of complex interactions and feedbacks that occur between microbes, plants and their physical environment in the context of climate change, and the influence of other global changes which have the capacity to amplify climate-driven effects on soil microbes. Overall, we emphasize the urgent need for greater understanding of how soil microbial ecology contributes to land{\textendash}atmosphere carbon exchange in the context of climate change, and identify some challenges for the future. In particular, we highlight the need for a multifactor experimental approach to understand how soil microbes and their activities respond to climate change and consequences for carbon cycle feedbacks.},

Most of the phenotypic characteristics pointed out for T. bacillaris are currently attributed to Candida zemplinina Sipiczki. In the present work isoenzyme profiles and rDNA restriction profiles of the neotype of S. bacillaris from two yeast culture collections (CBS 843 and PYCC 3044) and of the type strain of C. zemplinina (CBS 9494) were determined and similar profiles were detected. Moreover, the sequences of the D1/D2 region of the 26S rRNA gene of the three strains were 100 \% identical. Different profiles were observed for the type strain of C. stellata (CBS 157) both for isoenzyme and rDNA restriction analysis and only 91 \% similarity was found between the D1/D2 sequence of this strain and that of the neotype of S. bacillaris. In view of the newly obtained data and the fact that all above-mentioned species belong to the Starmerella clade, only distantly related to Candida tropicalis (the type species of the genus), S. bacillaris is hereby reinstated as Starmerella bacillaris comb. nov., with C. zemplinina as an obligate synonym.},

	abstract = {Understanding diversity and distribution patterns of fungi, including yeasts, ultimately depends on accuracy of species recognition. However, different approaches to yeast species recognition often result in different entities or operational taxonomic units. We studied the effects of using different yeast species recognition approaches, namely morphological species recognition (MSR) and phylogenetic species recognition (PSR), on the distribution patterns of widespread basidiomycetous yeasts. Hence, we have revised a collection of yeast fungi isolated from spatially remote birch forests in the Moscow Region and Western Siberia with molecular typing and identification tools. PCR fingerprinting and rDNA sequencing analyses of strains of nine species previously identified on the basis of morphological and physiological tests (MSR) yielded 21 phylogenetic species (PSR), including three currently undescribed taxa. The number of distinct phylogenetic species comprised within a single morphospecies ranged from one to seven. A total of ten species were found in both regions, whereas the distribution of 11 yeasts was restricted to a single region only. Both geographical region and type of substrate (plant or soil) influence yeast distribution. Cryptococcus wieringae, C. victoriae, C. magnus, and Leucosporidium scottii were frequently found on plant substrates, whereas C. terricola and C. podzolicus were associated to soil substrates. Occurrence of C. magnus, C. albidus and Sporobolomyces roseus was found to depend on the geographical region. Microsatellite-PCR fingerprinting, MSP-PCR, applied to studying yeast intraspecific variability revealed three different types of distribution: (a) variability that depends on geographical factors (Curvibasidium cygneicollum, C. podzolicus, C. victoriae), (b) genetic identity irrespectively of the region of isolation (Rhodotorula pinicola, C. terricola), and (c) high degree of genetic variability that did not correlate with region of sampling (C. albidus and C. magnus).},

Both these species occurred almost always on the leaves of deciduous trees. Rh. glutinis was the most frequently isolated carotenoids producing species.

Yeasts are recovered from a wide range of aquatic, marine, atmospheric, and terrestrial habitats. Many yeasts occur widely, whereas some appear to be confined to specific habitats. Yeasts seldom occur in the absence of either molds or bacteria. Consequently, selective techniques are often used for recovery of yeasts, employing media that permit the yeasts to grow, while suppressing molds and bacteria. Under the morphological characterization of yeasts there are several factors that include: texture, color, surface, elevation, and margin. In texture, mucoid growth is frequently associated with encapsulation of cells from production of extracellular polysaccharides; membranous growth generally results from profuse formation of hyphae or pseudohyphae. In color, the presence of red, orange, or yellow nondiffusible carotenoid pigments is characteristic of certain genera, for instance, Phaffia, Rhodosporidium, and Sporidiobolus. In surface, the strains that are smooth when first isolated sometimes become rough when maintained on agar. This change is, in some cases, accompanied by a change in texture from butyrous to membranous. Restreaking generally results, once again, in formation of smooth and rough colonies. In elevation, the growth is flat, depressed in the center, raised and dome-like, or conical. And in margin, the edge of the streak or colony is entire, undulating, lobed, erose, or fringed with hyphae or pseudohyphae.},

This chapter studies the genus Sporopachydermia. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that asexual reproduction is by multilateral budding on a narrow base. Cells are ovoid, ellipsoid, or elongate and occasionally curved. Pseudohyphae and true hyphae are not formed. Cultures growing on agar media have a strong, unpleasant odor. In sexual reproduction it is found that the conjugation may or may not precede ascus formation. The ascospores are spheroid, subglobose, ellipsoid, or bacilliform. One to four ascospores are formed per ascus. The spores usually have a thick coat of refractile material. They are liberated from the ascus at maturity and are kept together by the refractile material. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which glucose fermentation is absent or weak and nitrate is not assimilated. Myo-inositol as sole carbon source is assimilated, coenzyme Q-9 is formed, and the diazonium blue B reaction can be negative or positive. The type species taken is Sporopachydermia lactativora.},

Currently active transposons are highly polymorphic in host populations, including, among hundreds of others, L1 and Alu elements in humans and Ty1 elements in yeast. For this reason, we wished to develop a simple genome-wide method for identifying all transposons in any given sample. We have designed a transposon insertion site profiling chip (TIP-chip), a microarray intended for use as a high-throughput technique for mapping transposon insertions. By selectively amplifying transposon flanking regions and hybridizing them to the array, we can locate all transposons present in a sample. We have tested the TIP-chip extensively to map Ty1 retrotransposon insertions in yeast and have achieved excellent results in two laboratory strains as well as in evolved Ty1 high-copy strains. We are able to identify all of the theoretically detectable transposons in the FY2 lab strain, with essentially no false positives. In addition, we mapped many new transposon copies in the high-copy Ty1 strain and determined its Ty1 insertion pattern.},

Current conservation plans for tigers focus on population expansion, with the goal of doubling census size in the next 10 years. Previous studies have shown that because the demographic decline was recent, tiger populations still retain a large amount of genetic diversity. Although maintaining this diversity is extremely important to avoid deleterious effects of inbreeding, management plans have yet to consider predictive genetic models. We used coalescent simulations based on previously sequenced mitochondrial fragments (n = 125) from 5 of 6 extant subspecies to predict the population growth needed to maintain current genetic diversity over the next 150 years. We found that the level of gene flow between populations has a large effect on the local population growth necessary to maintain genetic diversity, without which tigers may face decreases in fitness. In the absence of gene flow, we demonstrate that maintaining genetic diversity is impossible based on known demographic parameters for the species. Thus, managing for the genetic diversity of the species should be prioritized over the riskier preservation of distinct subspecies. These predictive simulations provide unique management insights, hitherto not possible using existing analytical methods.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter studies the genus Yamadazyma. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that cell division is by multilateral budding on a narrow base and budded cells are spherical to elongate. Cells of some species have irregular shapes, including a triangular morphology. Pseudohyphae and true hyphae are formed by some species. In sexual reproduction it is found that the asci may be unconjugated or form following conjugation between a cell and its bud or between independent cells. Asci form one to four hat-shaped ascospores, which are released at maturity. Some species are homothallic but others are heterothallic. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which glucose is usually fermented and other sugars may be fermented as well. Many of the sugars, polyols, and organic acids used for yeast identification are assimilated, but nitrate is not utilized. Growth is absent in vitamin-free medium. The major ubiquinone is CoQ-9 and the diazonium blue B test is negative. The type species taken is Yamadazyma philogaea. This study describes the genus Yamadazyma for species of Pichia that formed hat-shaped ascospores, which were released from the ascus at maturity, produced pseudohyphae, fermented sugars, required an exogenous source of vitamins for growth, and had CoQ-9 as the major ubiquinone. As proposed, Yamadazyma included the following 16 species: Y.acaciae, Y.besseyi, Y.castillae, Y.farinosa, Y.guilliermondii, Y.haplophila, Y.inositovora, Y.media, Y.mexicana, Y. nakazawae, Y. ohmeri, Y.philogaea, Y.scolyti, Y. segobiensis, Y.spartinae, and Y.stipitis.},

To determine whether a similar phenomenon exists at human centromeres, we measured the rate of meiotic recombination across the centromere of the human X chromosome. We have constructed a long-range physical map of centromeric alpha-satellite DNA (DXZ1) by pulsed-field gel analysis, as well as detailed meiotic maps of the pericentromeric region of the X chromosome in the CEPH family panel. By comparing these two maps, we determined that, in the proximal region of the X chromosome, a genetic distance of 0.57 cM exists between markers that span the centromere and are separated by at least the average 3600 kb physical distance mapped across the DXZ1 array. Therefore, the rate of meiotic exchange across the X chromosome centromere is {\textless}1 cM/6300 kb (and perhaps as low as 1 cM/17,000 kb on the basis of other physical mapping data), at least eightfold lower than the average rate of female recombination on the X chromosome and one of the lowest rates of exchange yet observed in the human genome.},

High-quality, public datasets of SMRT sequences can spur development of analytic tools that can accommodate unique characterisitcs of SMRT data (long read lengths, lack of GC or amplification bias, and a random error profile leading to high consensus accuracy). In this paper, we describe eight high-coverage SMRT sequence datasets from five organisms (Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Neurospora crassa, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Drosophila melanogaster) that have been publicly released to the general scientific community (NCBI Sequence Read Archive ID SRP040522). Data were generated using two sequencing chemistries (P4-C2 and P5-C3) on the PacBio RS II instrument. The datasets reported here can be used without restriction by the research community to generate whole-genome assemblies, test new algorithms, investigate genome structure and evolution, and identify base modifications in some of the most widely-studied model systems in biological research.},

To compare the evolution of coding and noncoding sequences, we have conducted a survey for DNA polymorphism at five randomly chosen loci among a diverse collection of 81 strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Average rates of both polymorphism and divergence are 40\% lower at noncoding sites and 90\% lower at nonsynonymous sites in comparison to synonymous sites. Although noncoding and coding sequences show substantial variability in ratios of polymorphism to divergence, two of the loci, MLS1 and PDR10, show a higher rate of polymorphism at noncoding compared to synonymous sites. The high rate of polymorphism is not accompanied by a high rate of divergence and is limited to a few small regions. These hypervariable regions include sites with three segregating bases at a single site and adjacent polymorphic sites. We show that this clustering of polymorphic sites is significantly greater than one would expect on the basis of the spacing between polymorphic fourfold degenerate sites. Although hypervariable noncoding sequences could result from selection on regulatory mutations, they could also result from transient mutational hotspots.},

In contrast to the well-documented successes of crop and livestock breeding, processes of microbe domestication remain obscure, despite the importance of microbes to the production of food, beverages, and biofuels. Lager-beer, first brewed in the 15th century, employs an allotetraploid hybrid yeast, Saccharomyces pastorianus (syn. Saccharomyces carlsbergensis), a domesticated species created by the fusion of a Saccharomyces cerevisiae ale-yeast with an unknown cryotolerant Saccharomyces species. We report the isolation of that species and designate it Saccharomyces eubayanus sp. nov. because of its resemblance to Saccharomyces bayanus (a complex hybrid of S. eubayanus, Saccharomyces uvarum, and S. cerevisiae found only in the brewing environment). Individuals from populations of S. eubayanus and its sister species, S. uvarum, exist in apparent sympatry in Nothofagus (Southern beech) forests in Patagonia, but are isolated genetically through intrinsic postzygotic barriers, and ecologically through host-preference. The draft genome sequence of S. eubayanus is 99.5\% identical to the non-S. cerevisiae portion of the S. pastorianus genome sequence and suggests specific changes in sugar and sulfite metabolism that were crucial for domestication in the lager-brewing environment. This study shows that combining microbial ecology with comparative genomics facilitates the discovery and preservation of wild genetic stocks of domesticated microbes to trace their history, identify genetic changes, and suggest paths to further industrial improvement.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subtelomeres, regions proximal to telomeres, exhibit characteristics unique to eukaryotic genomes. Genes residing in these loci are subject to epigenetic regulation and elevated rates of both meiotic and mitotic recombination. However, most genome sequences do not contain assembled subtelomeric sequences, and, as a result, subtelomeres are often overlooked in comparative genomics.
RESULTS: We studied the evolution and functional divergence of subtelomeric gene families in the yeast lineage. Our computational results show that subtelomeric families are evolving and expanding much faster than families that do not contain subtelomeric genes. Focusing on three related subtelomeric MAL gene families involved in disaccharide metabolism that show typical patterns of rapid expansion and evolution, we show experimentally how frequent duplication events followed by functional divergence yield novel alleles that allow the metabolism of different carbohydrates.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our computational and experimental analyses show that the extraordinary instability of eukaryotic subtelomeres supports rapid adaptation to novel niches by promoting gene recombination and duplication followed by functional divergence of the alleles.},

This chapter studies the genus Zygotorulaspora. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that cell division is by multilateral budding on a narrow base, and budded cells are spherical to ellipsoidal. Pseudohyphae may be present, but true hyphae are not formed. In sexual reproduction it is found that the asci are persistent and may be unconjugated or show conjugation between a cell and its bud or between independent cells. Asci produce one to four smooth, spherical to subspherical ascospores. The species appear to be homothallic. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which glucose and other sugars are fermented. Nitrate is not assimilated, pellicles are absent, coenzyme Q-6 is produced, and the diazonium blue B test is negative. The type species taken is Zygotorulaspora mrakii. Single gene phylogenetic analyses showed Z. florentina and Z. mrakii to be sister species but indicated that they were not species of Zygosaccharomyces. When analyzed in a multigene dataset, Z. florentina and Z. mrakii formed a sister clade with the genus Torulaspora. Although the two species are closely associated with Torulaspora, Kurtzman suggested that they represent a sister genus rather than divergent species of Torulaspora and proposed the genus Zygotorulaspora for Z. florentina and Z. mrakii.},

(1996) TREE 11, 247-251 and Bensasson, D., Zhang, D., Hartl, D. L. \& Hewitt, G. M. (2001) TREE 16, 314-321]. When trying to identify the species origin of an unknown DNA sample by way of an mtDNA locus, PCR may amplify both mtDNA and numts. Indeed, occasionally numts dominate confounding attempts at species identification [Bensasson, D., Zhang, D. X. \& Hewitt, G. M. (2000) Mol. Biol. Evol. 17, 406-415; Wallace, D. C., et al. (1997) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94, 14900-14905].

They were accompanied by a number of putative numts. To confirm that these putative numts were of macaque origin, a library of numts corresponding to a small segment of 12S rDNA locus has been made by using DNA from a Chinese rhesus macaque. A broad distribution was found with up to 30\% sequence variation. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the evolutionary trajectories of numts and bona fide mtDNA haplotypes do not overlap with the signal exception of the host species; mtDNA fragments are continually crossing over into the germ line. In the case of divergent mtDNA sequences from old oral polio vaccine samples [Blancou, P., et al. (2001) Nature (London) 410, 1045-1046], all were closely related to numts in the Chinese macaque library.},

This chapter studies the genus Trichomonascus. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that colonies are often dry in texture and tannish-white. Asexual reproduction is by multilateral budding and the formation of pseudohyphae and true hyphae, which often produce short chains of blastoconidia that form sympodially. Septa have micropores.The anamorph genus is Blastobotrys. In sexual reproduction it is found that the species may be heterothallic or homothallic. Gametangia may form on hyphal tips or on hyphae after fusion of two intercalary cells by lateral outgrowths. Asci are globose to ellipsoidal with firm, thick walls and contain two to four ascospores. Ascospores are long-ellipsoidal to fusiform or hat- or helmet-shaped. Asci may bear a sterile apical cell. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus, in which sugars may be fermented, nitrate is not assimilated, and the diazonium blue B reaction is negative. The type species taken is Trichomonascus mycophagus. The fungus is unusual because it is characterized by an ascus that develops from a hyphal tip and is soon accompanied by a slender {\textquotedblleft}trichogyne-like{\textquotedblright} hypha that arises from the basal cell supporting the ascus. The tip of the trichogyne-like hypha fuses with the top of the ascus, giving the appearance of having completed a fertilization process. The hypha and the apex of the ascus, which becomes a separate cell, broaden and fuse to form an inverted, lipid-filled, claw-like structure that partially enclosed the ascus.},

The yeast LTR retrotransposon Ty1 preferentially integrates into a target window upstream of tDNAs (tRNA genes) in the yeast genome. We investigated the nature of these insertions and the target window on a genomic scale by analyzing several hundred de novo insertions upstream of tDNAs in two different multicopy gene families. The pattern of insertion upstream of tDNAs was nonrandom and periodic, with peaks separated by [{\textasciitilde}]80 bp. Insertions were not distributed equally throughout the genome, as certain tDNAs within a given family received higher frequencies of upstream Ty1 insertions than others. We showed that the presence and relative position of additional tDNAs and LTRs surrounding the target tDNA dramatically influenced the frequency of insertion events upstream of that target.},

A full understanding of TE evolutionary dynamics must consider how these forces jointly determine their proliferation within genomes. Here I consider these forces from two perspectives {\textendash} dynamics within populations and evolutionary games within the germline.

	abstract = {The natural history of the model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is poorly understood and confounded by domestication. In nature, S. cerevisiae and its undomesticated relative S. paradoxus are usually found on the bark of oak trees, a habitat very different from wine or other human fermentations. It is unclear whether the oak trees are really the primary habitat for wild yeast, or whether this apparent association is due to biased sampling. We use culturing and high-throughput environmental sequencing to show that S. paradoxus is a very rare member of the oak bark microbial community. We find that S. paradoxus can grow well on sterile medium made from oak bark, but that its growth is strongly suppressed when the other members of the community are present. We purified a set of twelve common fungal and bacterial species from the oak bark community and tested how each affected the growth of S. paradoxus in direct competition on oak bark medium at summer and winter temperatures, identifying both positive and negative interactions. One Pseudomonas species produces a diffusible toxin that suppresses S. paradoxus as effectively as either the whole set of twelve species together or the complete community present in nonsterilized oak medium. Conversely, one of the twelve species, Mucilaginibacter sp., had the opposite effect and promoted S. paradoxus growth at low temperatures. We conclude that, in its natural oak tree habitat, S. paradoxus is a rare species whose success depends on the much more abundant microbial species surrounding it.},

We show that, although biodiversity can never be fully captured by a single number, study of particular facets has led to rapid, exciting and sometimes alarming discoveries. Phylogenetic and temporal analyses are shedding light on the ecological and evolutionary processes that have shaped current biodiversity. There is no doubt that humans are now destroying this diversity at an alarming rate. A vital question now being tackled is how badly this loss affects ecosystem functioning. Although current research efforts are impressive, they are tiny in comparison to the amount of unknown diversity and the urgency and importance of the task.},

	doi = {10.1093/molbev/msj050},
	abstract = {Most of the phenotypic diversity that we perceive in the natural world is directly attributable to the peculiar structure of the eukaryotic gene, which harbors numerous embellishments relative to the situation in prokaryotes. The most profound changes include introns that must be spliced out of precursor mRNAs, transcribed but untranslated leader and trailer sequences (untranslated regions), modular regulatory elements that drive patterns of gene expression, and expansive intergenic regions that harbor additional diffuse control mechanisms. Explaining the origins of these features is difficult because they each impose an intrinsic disadvantage by increasing the genic mutation rate to defective alleles. To address these issues, a general hypothesis for the emergence of eukaryotic gene structure is provided here. Extensive information on absolute population sizes, recombination rates, and mutation rates strongly supports the view that eukaryotes have reduced genetic effective population sizes relative to prokaryotes, with especially extreme reductions being the rule in multicellular lineages. The resultant increase in the power of random genetic drift appears to be sufficient to overwhelm the weak mutational disadvantages associated with most novel aspects of the eukaryotic gene, supporting the idea that most such changes are simple outcomes of semi-neutral processes rather than direct products of natural selection. However, by establishing an essentially permanent change in the population-genetic environment permissive to the genome-wide repatterning of gene structure, the eukaryotic condition also promoted a reliable resource from which natural selection could secondarily build novel forms of organismal complexity. Under this hypothesis, arguments based on molecular, cellular, and/or physiological constraints are insufficient to explain the disparities in gene, genomic, and phenotypic complexity between prokaryotes and eukaryotes.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous mutations are the source of genetic variation required for evolutionary change, and are therefore important for many aspects of evolutionary biology. For example, the divergence between taxa at neutrally evolving sites in the genome is proportional to the per nucleotide mutation rate, u (ref. 1), and this can be used to date speciation events by assuming a molecular clock. The overall rate of occurrence of deleterious mutations in the genome each generation (U) appears in theories of nucleotide divergence and polymorphism, the evolution of sex and recombination, and the evolutionary consequences of inbreeding. However, estimates of U based on changes in allozymes or DNA sequences and fitness traits are discordant. Here we directly estimate u in Drosophila melanogaster by scanning 20 million bases of DNA from three sets of mutation accumulation lines by using denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography. From 37 mutation events that we detected, we obtained a mean estimate for u of 8.4 10-9 per generation. Moreover, we detected significant heterogeneity in u among the three mutation-accumulation-line genotypes. By multiplying u by an estimate of the fraction of mutations that are deleterious in natural populations of Drosophila, we estimate that U is 1.2 per diploid genome. This high rate suggests that selection against deleterious mutations may have a key role in explaining patterns of genetic variation in the genome, and help to maintain recombination and sexual reproduction.},

Arguments proposed to explain this disparity include selection for metabolic efficiency and elevated rates of deletion in microbes, but the evidence in support of these hypotheses is at best equivocal. An alternative explanation based on fundamental population-genetic principles is proposed here. By increasing the mutational target sizes of associated genes, most forms of nonfunctional DNA are opposed by weak selection. Free-living microbial species have elevated effective population sizes, and the consequent reduction in the power of random genetic drift appears to be sufficient to enable natural selection to inhibit the accumulation of excess DNA. This hypothesis provides a potentially unifying explanation for the continuity in genomic scaling from prokaryotes to multicellular eukaryotes, the divergent patterns of mitochondrial evolution in animals and land plants, and various aspects of genomic modification in microbial endosymbionts.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
Food and beverage spoilage by yeasts is well-documented in the literature. Spoilage is a consequence of yeast growth in the product. Food components are utilized as growth substrates by the yeasts and are transformed into a vast array of metabolic end products. In this way, the chemical, physical, and sensory properties of the food are changed. Yeast spoilage becomes evident to the consumer in many ways, depending on the product. The ecological principles that govern the occurrence and growth of microorganisms in foods in general also apply to yeast spoilage of foods. To understand and manage food and beverage spoilage by yeasts, a systematic process of investigation and knowledge acquisition is required. Yeasts are widely distributed in the environment and, consequently, contaminate most foods and beverages. Prevention of spoilage requires good manufacturing practices, including application of the principles of hazard analysis critical control point (HACCP) analysis, other quality management programs, and good hygienic practices. Since most yeasts grow well at low temperatures, refrigeration does not prevent spoilage; it only slows down its occurrence. Prevention and minimization of contamination are, therefore, key requirements in the management of yeast spoilage.},

Lager-brewing arose in 15th century Bavaria [1] and is nowadays the most popular technique for alcoholic beverage production in the world. The technique is characterized by low temperature fermentation using the domesticated yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus (synonym S. carlsbergensis). It has been clear that the lager yeast is a hybrid with one portion of its genome having originated from S. cerevisiae ale yeast [2]. However, the source of the non-ale subgenome, which endows lager yeast with cold tolerance, had been a matter of debate [3]. Recently, a Patagonian origin hypothesis of lager yeast has been proposed based on the discovery of a new cryotolerant Saccharomyces species from Patagonian native forests of Argentina [4]. This yeast, named S. eubayanus, exhibited the closest known match (99.56\%) to the non-ale portion of lager yeast and, thus, was believed to be its progenitor. However, we now show that this yeast species is likely native to the Tibetan Plateau. One of the Tibetan populations of the species exhibits closer affinity with lager yeast than the Patagonian population as inferred from population genetics and genome sequence analyses. We thus provide strong evidence for a Far East Asian origin hypothesis of lager yeast, which apparently corresponds better with geography and world trade history.},

This chapter studies the genus Pachysolen. The genus Pachysolen is a member of a large clade that includes Nakazawaea, Citeromyces, Ogataea, and Kuraishia. In the determination of the asexual reproduction, it is seen that budding is multilateral and on a narrow base. Cells are spherical to ellipsoidal and may have one or two small apiculi. Pseudohyphae may be poorly developed or absent. True hyphae are not formed. In sexual reproduction it is found that asci are morphologically distinct, and their presence allows immediate recognition of this genus. Generally, a tube grows from a budded cell and the end of the tube forms an ascus, usually containing four ascospores. The walls of the cell and tube become markedly thickened and refractile. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Pachysolen tannophilus. In the systematic discussion of the species, synonyms, growth on 5\% malt extract agar, growth on the surface of assimilation media, Dalmau plate culture on morphology agar, formation of ascospores, gene sequence accession number, type strain, origin of the strains studied, and systematics are determined.},

	abstract = {The effects of genetic variants on phenotypic traits often depend on environmental and physiological conditions, but such gene{\textendash}environment interactions are poorly understood. Recently developed approaches that treat transcript abundances of thousands of genes as quantitative traits offer the opportunity to broadly characterize the architecture of gene{\textendash}environment interactions. We examined the genetic and molecular basis of variation in gene expression between two yeast strains (BY and RM) grown in two different conditions (glucose and ethanol as carbon sources). We observed that most transcripts vary by strain and condition, with 2,996, 3,448, and 2,037 transcripts showing significant strain, condition, and strain{\textendash}condition interaction effects, respectively. We expression profiled over 100 segregants derived from a cross between BY and RM in both growth conditions, and identified 1,555 linkages for 1,382 transcripts that show significant gene{\textendash}environment interaction. At the locus level, local linkages, which usually correspond to polymorphisms in cis-regulatory elements, tend to be more stable across conditions, such that they are more likely to show the same effect or the same direction of effect across conditions. Distant linkages, which usually correspond to polymorphisms influencing trans-acting factors, are more condition-dependent, and often show effects in different directions in the two conditions. We characterized a locus that influences expression of many growth-related transcripts, and showed that the majority of the variation is explained by polymorphism in the gene IRA2. The RM allele of IRA2 appears to inhibit Ras/PKA signaling more strongly than the BY allele, and has undergone a change in selective pressure. Our results provide a broad overview of the genetic architecture of gene{\textendash}environment interactions, as well as a detailed molecular example, and lead to key insights into how the effects of different classes of regulatory variants are modulated by the environment. These observations will guide the design of studies aimed at understanding the genetic basis of complex traits.},

This chapter reviews the data that are currently available in yeast comparative genomics, and discusses how taxonomists can access and make use of these data. Genomes can be sequenced to various levels of completion. The {\textquotedblleft}gold standard{\textquotedblright} is a sequence that spans every chromosome from telomere to telomere, with no gaps or ambiguities. The genome sequence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae comes close to meeting this standard, but even for this species it has proved impossible (with current technology) to determine the complete sequence of the rDNA locus. An alternative strategy in genomics is whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing without further finishing. This strategy saves much time and expense, but loses out in terms of the completeness of the information obtained. The shotgun sequencing process involves {\textquotedblleft}assembling{\textquotedblright} the raw data, by finding overlaps between individual sequence reads of random fragments of genomic DNA to form larger {\textquotedblleft}contigs{\textquotedblright} of contiguous genomic sequence data.},

This chapter studies the genus Debaryomyces. In the determination of asexual reproduction, cell division is by multilateral budding. Pseudohyphae may be absent or poorly developed. In sexual reproduction it is seen that asci show conjugation between a cell and its bud, or between independent cells. Ascospores are globose, ovoid, or lenticular and have smooth or warty walls that may also have spiral ridges. Ascospores are not liberated from the ascus except in one species. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that fermentation is positive, weak, or absent. Nitrate is not assimilated. The major ubiquinone is CoQ-9. The diazonium blue B reaction is negative. This study further examines the phylogenetic placement where Debaryomyces and Schwanniomyces are sister genera. The type of species mentioned is Debaryomyces hansenii. The species accepted are Debaryomyces coudertii, Debaryomyces fabryi, Debaryomyces hansenii, Debaryomyces maramus, Debaryomyces mycophilus, Debaryomyces nepalensis, Debaryomyces prosopidis, Debaryomyces robertsiae, Debaryomyces singareniensis, Debaryomyces subglobosus, and Debaryomyces udenii.

Sympodially produced blastoconidia may also be present. Budding is absent. Chlamydospores may be formed. Septa have micropores. In sexual reproduction it is found that Dipodascus and Galactomyces represent the teleomorphic states of Geotrichum. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which fermentation is often absent. D-Xylose is assimilated, nitrate is not assimilated, and extracellular starch is not produced. The diazonium blue B reaction is negative and small subunit rRNA gene sequences are without deletions.

Most strikingly, in one family we observed that 92\% of germline DNMs were from the paternal germline, while, in complete contrast, in the other family 64\% of DNMs were from the maternal germline.

We demonstrate that the mismatch recognition heterodimer hMSH2-hMSH6 disassembles a nucleosome. Disassembly requires a mismatch that provokes the formation of hMSH2-hMSH6 hydrolysis-independent sliding clamps, which translocate along the DNA to the nucleosome. The rate of disassembly is enhanced by actual or mimicked acetylation of histone H3 within the nucleosome entry-exit and dyad axis that occurs during replication and repair in vivo and reduces DNA-octamer affinity in vitro. Our results support a passive mechanism for chromatin remodeling whereby hMSH2-hMSH6 sliding clamps trap localized fluctuations in nucleosome positioning and/or wrapping that ultimately leads to disassembly, and highlight unanticipated strengths of the Molecular Switch Model for mismatch repair (MMR).},

However, several wild Oryza species lack the CentO repeat. We developed a chromatin immunoprecipitation-based technique to clone DNA fragments derived from chromatin containing the centromeric histone H3 variant CenH3. Chromatin immunoprecipitation cloning was carried out in the CentO-less species Oryza rhizomatis (CC genome) and Oryza brachyantha (FF genome). Three previously uncharacterized genome-specific satellite repeats, CentO-C1, CentO-C2, and CentO-F, were discovered in the centromeres of these two species. An 80-bp DNA region was found to be conserved in CentO-C1, CentO, and centromeric satellite repeats from maize and pearl millet, species which diverged from rice many millions of years ago. In contrast, the CentO-F repeat shows no sequence similarity to other centromeric repeats but has almost completely replaced other centromeric sequences in O. brachyantha, including the CRR-related sequences that normally constitute a significant fraction of the centromeric DNA in grass species.},

This chapter studies the genus Lindnera. In the determination of asexual reproduction, budding is multilateral on a narrow base. Cells are spherical, ovoid, or elongate. Pseudohyphae and true hyphae are produced by some species. In sexual reproduction it is seen that asci may be unconjugated or show conjugation between a cell and its bud or between independent cells. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that glucose is fermented by all species, and other sugars are fermented by some species. This study also examines the phylogenetic placement. The type of species mentioned is Lindnera americana. The species accepted are Lindnera americana, Lindnera amylophila, Lindnera bimundalis, Lindnera euphorbiae, Lindnera euphorbiiphila, Lindnera fabianii, and Lindnera jadinii.

	abstract = {Limited comparative studies suggest that the human genome is particularly enriched for recent segmental duplications. The extent of segmental duplications in other mammalian genomes is unknown and confounded by methodological differences in genome assembly. Here, we present a detailed analysis of recent duplication content within the mouse genome using a whole-genome assembly comparison method and a novel assembly independent method, designed to take advantage of the reduced allelic variation of the C57BL/6J strain. We conservatively estimate that [{\textasciitilde}]57\% of all highly identical segmental duplications ([IMG]=" BORDER="0"{\textgreater}90\%) were misassembled or collapsed within the working draft WGS assembly. The WGS approach often leaves duplications fragmented and unassigned to a chromosome when compared with the clone-ordered-based approach. Our preliminary analysis suggests that 1.7\%-2.0\% of the mouse genome is part of recent large segmental duplications (about half of what is observed for the human genome). We have constructed a mouse segmental duplication database to aid in the characterization of these regions and their integration into the final mouse genome assembly. This work suggests significant biological differences in the architecture of recent segmental duplications between human and mouse. In addition, our unique method provides the means for improving whole-genome shotgun sequence assembly of mouse and future mammalian genomes.},

Furthermore, it is often difficult to identify or exclude the origins of disease-causing yeast from specific environmental reservoirs. In this study, we compared the yeast isolates from tree hollows and from clinics in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. Our surveys and analyses showed significant differences in yeast species composition, in their temporal dynamics, and in yeast genotypes between isolates from tree hollows and hospitals. Our results are inconsistent with the hypothesis that yeast from trees constitute a significant source of pathogenic yeast in humans in this region. Similarly, the yeast in humans and clinics do not appear to contribute to yeast in tree hollows.},

This chapter studies the genus Bensingtonia. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that colonies are whitish, cream, pale pink, brownish-yellow (ochre), brownish, or grayish-red. True hyphae and/or pseudohyphae may be present. Hyphal septa attenuate toward a central pore. Yeast cells are ellipsoidal, ovoid, or elongate. Budding is usually polar, with buds sessile or on short denticles, enteroblastic, and with per-current or sympodial proliferation. Ballistoconidia are bilaterally symmetrical, straight or curved, apiculate, ellipsoidal, ovoid, amygdaliform, falcate, allantoid, or reniform. In the sexual reproduction basidiocarps are absent. Species may be heterothallic. Conjugation of compatible mating types of Bensingtonia intermedia results in the formation of a teleomorphic stage, which is classified in the genus Mastigobasidium. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Bensingtonia ciliata. The key characters of species assigned to the genus Bensingtonia are presented.

We used a high-resolution and high-precision phenotypic profiling approach to quantify the fitness contribution of genes on the five smallest yeast chromosomes during different forms of environmental stress, selected to probe a wide diversity of physiological features. We found that the extent of pleiotropy is much higher than previously claimed; 17\% of the yeast genes were pleiotropic whereof one-fifth were hyper-pleiotropic. Pleiotropic genes preferentially participate in functions related to determination of protein fate, cell growth and morphogenesis, signal transduction and transcription. Contrary to what has earlier been proposed we did not find experimental evidence for slower evolutionary rate of pleiotropic genes/proteins. We also refute the existence of phenotypic islands along chromosomes but report on a remarkable loss both of pleiotropy and of phenotypic penetrance towards chromosomal ends. Thus, the here reported features of pleiotropy both have implications on our understanding of evolutionary processes as well as the mechanisms underlying disease.},

Assuming a weak deleterious effect of each TE insertion, a decrease in fitness is expected with an increase in genomic TE copy number. Higher rates of ectopic exchanges and, consequently, chromosomal rearrangements resulting in early embryonic death are also predicted from an increase in TE copy number. Therefore egg hatchability is expected to decrease as the genomic TE copy number increases. In 2b, where replicate lines have diverged up by 90 TE copies per haploid genome, a negative correlation between the number of TE insertions and both fitness and egg hatchability were found. Neither correlation was significant for the Harwich replicates, which have only diverged by 30 TE copies. The average deleterious effect of a TE insertion on fitness and its components was estimated as 0.004. Both homozygous and heterozygous TE insertions were shown to have deleterious effects on fitness and its components.},

This chapter studies the genus Zygosaccharomyces. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that cell division is by multilateral budding on a narrow base. Cells are spherical, ovoid, or elongate. Pseudohyphae, if formed, are generally not well differentiated, and true hyphae are not produced. In sexual reproduction it is found that the asci are persistent and are generally formed by conjugation, either between a cell and its bud or, more frequently, between independent cells, often with both cells producing ascospores, thus giving rise to a dumbbell-shaped ascus. Ascospores are smooth and globose to ellipsoidal, and there are one to four per ascus. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which glucose is fermented, but not galactose. Nitrate is not assimilated and pellicles are not formed on liquid medium. Coenzyme Q-6 is produced and diazonium blue B reaction is negative. The type species taken is Zygosaccharomyces rouxii. The taxonomic re-evaluation followed extensive work by Winge and Lindegren and their collaborators, who reported that no clear distinction could be made between the Saccharomyces, Torulaspora, or Zygosaccharomyces. The genus currently comprises just six species, but this number is likely to increase in the future as the accuracy of yeast identification continues to improve through the use of DNA-based methods such as ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. With regard to Zygosaccharomyces, rRNA gene sequencing has already proved invaluable, both for differentiating between physiologically similar species and for identifying new species and Z. lentus.},

It refers to an organism's ability to enter a reversible state of low metabolic activity when faced with unfavourable environmental conditions. Dormant microorganisms generate a seed bank, which comprises individuals that are capable of being resuscitated following environmental change. In this Review, we highlight mechanisms that have evolved in microorganisms to allow them to successfully enter and exit a dormant state, and discuss the implications of microbial seed banks for evolutionary dynamics, population persistence, maintenance of biodiversity, and the stability of ecosystem processes.},

	abstract = {We resequenced 876 short fragments in a sample of 96 individuals of Arabidopsis thaliana that included stock center accessions as well as a hierarchical sample from natural populations. Although A. thaliana is a selfing weed, the pattern of polymorphism in general agrees with what is expected for a widely distributed, sexually reproducing species. Linkage disequilibrium decays rapidly, within 50 kb. Variation is shared worldwide, although population structure and isolation by distance are evident. The data fail to fit standard neutral models in several ways. There is a genome-wide excess of rare alleles, at least partially due to selection. There is too much variation between genomic regions in the level of polymorphism. The local level of polymorphism is negatively correlated with gene density and positively correlated with segmental duplications. Because the data do not fit theoretical null distributions, attempts to infer natural selection from polymorphism data will require genome-wide surveys of polymorphism in order to identify anomalous regions. Despite this, our data support the utility of A. thaliana as a model for evolutionary functional genomics.},

	abstract = {AIMS: The objective of this work was to study the effect of the use of Saccharomyces cerevisiae monocultures over the biodiversity of non-Saccharomyces yeasts in wine-producing areas in Chile. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microvinifications were carried out with grape musts of two areas. In one of them, the fermentation is carried out mainly in a spontaneous manner, whereas in the other the musts are inoculated with commercial yeasts. The isolated yeasts were identified by the internal transcribed (ITS)/restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. In the industrial production area less variability of yeast genera was observed as compared with the traditional area, an observation that is greatest at the end of the fermentation. Furthermore, a study of the production of extracellular enzymes was done. The majority of the yeasts showed at least one of the activities assayed with the exception of beta-glycosidase. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that in the industrialized area the diversity of yeasts is less in the traditional area. Likewise, the potentiality of the non-Saccharomyces yeasts as enzyme producers with industrial interest has been confirmed. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study shows the negative effect of the use of monocultures over the biodiversity of yeasts in wine-producing regions.},

	abstract = {From the standpoints of both basic research and biotechnology, there is considerable interest in reaching a clearer understanding of the diversity of biological mechanisms employed during lignocellulose degradation. Globally, termites are an extremely successful group of wood-degrading organisms and are therefore important both for their roles in carbon turnover in the environment and as potential sources of biochemical catalysts for efforts aimed at converting wood into biofuels. Only recently have data supported any direct role for the symbiotic bacteria in the gut of the termite in cellulose and xylan hydrolysis. Here we use a metagenomic analysis of the bacterial community resident in the hindgut paunch of a wood-feeding 'higher' Nasutitermes species (which do not contain cellulose-fermenting protozoa) to show the presence of a large, diverse set of bacterial genes for cellulose and xylan hydrolysis. Many of these genes were expressed in vivo or had cellulase activity in vitro, and further analyses implicate spirochete and fibrobacter species in gut lignocellulose degradation. New insights into other important symbiotic functions including H2 metabolism, CO2-reductive acetogenesis and N2 fixation are also provided by this first system-wide gene analysis of a microbial community specialized towards plant lignocellulose degradation. Our results underscore how complex even a 1-microl environment can be.},

	abstract = {The genetics of the mating-type (MAT) locus have been studied extensively in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, but relatively little is known about how this complex system evolved. We compared the organization of MAT and mating-type-like (MTL) loci in nine species spanning the hemiascomycete phylogenetic tree. We inferred that the system evolved in a two-step process in which silent HMR/HML cassettes appeared, followed by acquisition of the Ho endonuclease from a mobile genetic element. Ho-mediated switching between an active MAT locus and silent cassettes exists only in the Saccharomyces sensu stricto group and their closest relatives: Candida glabrata, Kluyveromyces delphensis, and Saccharomyces castellii. We identified C. glabrata MTL1 as the ortholog of the MAT locus of K. delphensis and show that switching between C. glabrata MTL1a and MTL1\{alpha\} genotypes occurs in vivo. The more distantly related species Kluyveromyces lactis has silent cassettes but switches mating type without the aid of Ho endonuclease. Very distantly related species such as Candida albicans and Yarrowia lipolytica do not have silent cassettes. In Pichia angusta, a homothallic species, we found MAT\{alpha\}2, MAT\{alpha\}1, and MATa1 genes adjacent to each other on the same chromosome. Although some continuity in the chromosomal location of the MAT locus can be traced throughout hemiascomycete evolution and even to Neurospora, the gene content of the locus has changed with the loss of an HMG domain gene (MATa2) from the MATa idiomorph shortly after HO was recruited.},

For example, we estimate EGS in a complex, organism-dense farm soil sample at about 6.3 megabases (Mb) whereas that of the bacteria therein is only 4.7 Mb; for bacteria in a nutrient-poor, organism-sparse ocean surface water sample, EGS is as low as 1.6 Mb.

Current models for S.~cerevisiae suggest that its population comprises distinct domesticated and natural groups as well as mosaic strains, but we generally know little of the forces which shape its population structure. In order to test the roles that ecology and geography play in shaping the S.~cerevisiae species we examined nine variable microsatellite loci in 172 strains of S.~cerevisiae isolated from two spontaneous grape juice ferments, soil, flowers, apiaries and bark in New Zealand. Bayesian analysis shows that the S.~cerevisiae in NZ comprise a subdivided but interbreeding population that out-crosses \~{}20\% of the time. Some strains contributing to spontaneous ferments cluster with NZ soil/bark isolates, but others cluster with isolates from French oak barrels. It seems some strains have been globally dispersed by humans in oak barrels while some are locally vectored by insects. These data suggest geography is more important than ecology in shaping S.~cerevisiae's population structure.},

Based on our experience at the Joint Genome Institute, we describe the chain of decisions accompanying a metagenomic project from the viewpoint of the bioinformatic analysis step by step. We guide the reader through a standard workflow for a metagenomic project beginning with presequencing considerations such as community composition and sequence data type that will greatly influence downstream analyses. We proceed with recommendations for sampling and data generation including sample and metadata collection, community profiling, construction of shotgun libraries, and sequencing strategies. We then discuss the application of generic sequence processing steps (read preprocessing, assembly, and gene prediction and annotation) to metagenomic data sets in contrast to genome projects. Different types of data analyses particular to metagenomes are then presented, including binning, dominant population analysis, and gene-centric analysis. Finally, data management issues are presented and discussed. We hope that this review will assist bioinformaticians and biologists in making better-informed decisions on their journey during a metagenomic project.},

To investigate the composition of organisms in this space, we applied culture-independent approaches to microbes harvested from the air of two densely populated urban buildings, from which we analyzed 80 megabases genomic DNA sequence and 6000 16S rDNA clones. The air microbiota is primarily bacteria, including potential opportunistic pathogens commonly isolated from human-inhabited environments such as hospitals, but none of the data contain matches to virulent pathogens or bioterror agents. Comparison of air samples with each other and nearby environments suggested that the indoor air microbes are not random transients from surrounding outdoor environments, but rather originate from indoor niches. Sequence annotation by gene function revealed specific adaptive capabilities enriched in the air environment, including genes potentially involved in resistance to desiccation and oxidative damage. This baseline index of air microbiota will be valuable for improving designs of surveillance for natural or man-made release of virulent pathogens.},

However, modes of evolution cannot be inferred solely from the distribution of natural variation, because selection interacts with demography and mutation rates to shape polymorphism and divergence. We estimated the effects of naturally occurring mutations on gene expression while minimizing the effect of natural selection. We demonstrate that sensitivity of gene expression to mutations increases with both increasing trans-mutational target size and the presence of a TATA box. Genes with greater sensitivity to mutations are also more sensitive to systematic environmental perturbations and stochastic noise. These results provide a mechanistic basis for gene expression evolvability that can serve as a foundation for realistic models of regulatory evolution.},

	abstract = {Co-evolution of transcriptional regulatory proteins and their sites of action has been often hypothesized but rarely demonstrated. Here we provide experimental evidence of such co-evolution in yeast silent chromatin, a finding that emerged from studies of hybrids formed between two closely related Saccharomyces species. A unidirectional silencing incompatibility between S. cerevisiae and S. bayanus led to a key discovery: asymmetrical complementation of divergent orthologs of the silent chromatin component Sir4. In S. cerevisiae/S. bayanus interspecies hybrids, ChIP-Seq analysis revealed a restriction against S. cerevisiae Sir4 associating with most S. bayanus silenced regions; in contrast, S. bayanus Sir4 associated with S. cerevisiae silenced loci to an even greater degree than did S. cerevisiae's own Sir4. Functional changes in silencer sequences paralleled changes in Sir4 sequence and a reduction in Sir1 family members in S. cerevisiae. Critically, species-specific silencing of the S. bayanus HMR locus could be reconstituted in S. cerevisiae by co-transfer of the S. bayanus Sir4 and Kos3 (the ancestral relative of Sir1) proteins. As Sir1/Kos3 and Sir4 bind conserved silencer-binding proteins, but not specific DNA sequences, these rapidly evolving proteins served to interpret differences in the two species' silencers presumably involving emergent features created by the regulatory proteins that bind sequences within silencers. The results presented here, and in particular the high resolution ChIP-Seq localization of the Sir4 protein, provided unanticipated insights into the mechanism of silent chromatin assembly in yeast.},

The uniqueness of ORFans within a genome has precluded the use of a comparative approach to examine their function and evolution. However, by identifying sequences unique to monophyletic groups at increasing phylogenetic depths, we can make direct comparisons of the characteristics of ORFans of different ages in the Escherichia coli genome, and establish their functional status and evolutionary rates. Relative to the genes ancestral to \{gamma\}-Proteobacteria and to those genes distributed sporadically in other prokaryotic species, ORFans in the E. coli lineage are short, A+T rich, and evolve quickly. Moreover, most encode functional proteins. Based on these features, ORFans are not attributable to errors in gene annotation, limitations of current databases, or to failure of methods for detecting homology. Rather, ORFans in the genomes of free-living microorganisms apparently derive from bacteriophage and occasionally become established by assuming roles in key cellular functions.},

This chapter studies the genus Schizosaccharomyces. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that cells are globose to cylindrical and reproduce by fission. One species forms septate hyphae that separate into arthroconidia. In sexual reproduction it is found that the asci are usually produced by conjugation of independent cells. Ascospores are globose or short ellipsoidal, seldom cylindrical, and often liberated from the ascus. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which all species ferment glucose and other sugars may also be fermented. Nitrate is not assimilated, the starch test in Wickerham's liquid medium is positive, the diazonium blue B reaction is negative, and the species form either coenzyme Q-9 or coenzyme Q-10. The type species taken is Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Low interspecific DNA sequence homology as determined by DNA reassociation studies confirmed the separation of the genus Schizosaccharomyces into three species: Schiz.japonicus, Schiz.octos-porus, and Schiz.pombe.},

In order to describe this phenomenon, we systematically searched the 6404 intergenic regions (IRs) of the genome of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for traces of coding sequences presenting degenerated but still recognizable sequence similarity with active open reading frames (5823 annotated ORFs). We detected a total of 124 anciently coding regions, or "gene relics", showing similarity to a total of 149 distinct active ORFs. This set of relics shows a continuum of sequence degeneration from those whose sequence is slightly altered compared to the functional ORF (classically defined as pseudogenes), to those that contains so many deleterious mutations, as to reach the limit of recognition. Gene relics are more concentrated in the subtelomeric regions of the chromosomes, reflecting the high plasticity of these regions. The presence of relics also revealed ancestral duplication events of chromosomal segments that were previously undetected. Some of these segments are intermingled with the more easily recognizable ancestral blocks of duplication, indicating successive duplication events. We present a compilation of all the data available, leading to a total of 278 pseudogenes in the genome of S. cerevisiae.},

This chapter studies the genus Clavispora. In the determination of asexual reproduction, cells are ovoid, ellipsoidal, or elongate and divide by multilateral budding on a narrow base. Pseudohyphae may be formed, but true hyphae are absent. In sexual reproduction it is seen that conjugation of haploid cells of opposite mating types usually precedes ascus formation. Bud{\textendash}parent conjugation is also possible. Ascospores are usually clavate, rarely ovoid to spherical, and sometimes contain a small oil droplet. One or two (rarely three or four) ascospores are formed per ascus. The spore wall may have small warts, which are visible by electron microscopy. The spores are easily liberated from the ascus. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that glucose is fermented. Nitrate is not assimilated. Coenzyme Q-8 is formed. The diazonium blue B reaction is negative. This study further examines the phylogenetic placement where Clavispora is a sister genus to Metschnikowia in the family Metschnikowiaceae. The type of species mentioned is Clavispora lusitaniae.

Survival of larval cod is shown to depend on three key biological parameters of their prey: the mean size of prey, seasonal timing and abundance. We suggest a mechanism, involving the match/mismatch hypothesis, by which variability in temperature affects larval cod survival and conclude that rising temperature since the mid-1980s has modified the plankton ecosystem in a way that reduces the survival of young cod.},

This chapter studies the genus Lipomyces. In the determination of the asexual reproduction, it is seen that cells are ellipsoidal or globose and reproduce by multilateral budding and occasionally by rudimentary septation of cells with the formation of micropores (plasmadesmal canals) Ovoid to cylindrical giant cells may occur. Cells are hyaline and mostly surrounded by a mucoid capsule. Pseudohyphae are absent or rudimentary. Colonies are watery or mucoid to glutinous. Myxozyma represents the anamorph genus of Lipomyces. In sexual reproduction it is found that asci develop in various ways. They may arise from enlarging evaginations of a single cell ({\textquotedblleft}active bud{\textquotedblright}) that may or may not be preceded by conjugation, or they may arise following conjugation between separate cells. When asci develop from active buds, they often enlarge to an elongated pear shape. The wall of this type of ascus is thin. Two or more asci may arise from a single cell, and they may separate from the cell when mature. When the ascus is the result of conjugation of an active bud and a protuberance of a cell, the ascus wall is thicker. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Lipomyces starkeyi. The key characters of species assigned to the genus Lipomyces are presented. In the systematic discussion of the species, synonyms, growth in malt extract, growth on malt agar, Dalmau plate cultures on corn meal agar, formation of ascospores, gene sequence accession numbers, type strain, origin of the strain studied, systematics, and ecology are determined.},

This was achieved by applying tetrad analysis to a large number of yeast clones. The genomic rate of spontaneous mutation deleterious to a basic fitness-related trait, that of growth rate, was U = 1.1 x 10(-3) per diploid cell division. Extrapolated to the fruit fly and humans, the per generation rate would be 0.074 and 0.92, respectively. This is likely to be an underestimate because single mutations with selection coefficients s {\textless} 0.01 could not be detected. The distribution of s {\textgreater} or = 0.01 was studied both for spontaneous and induced mutations. The latter were induced by ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) or resulted from defective mismatch repair. Lethal changes accounted for approximately 30-40\% of the scored mutations. The mean s of nonlethal mutations was fairly high, but most frequently its value was between 0.01 and 0.05. Although the rate and distribution of very small effects could not be determined, the joint share of such mutations in decreasing average fitness was probably no larger than approximately 1\%.},

Gene sequences are not determined for any of the species assigned to Helicogonium. The taxonomic relationships of Helicogonium are not known, and until sequence data can be obtained, its position within the ascomycetes is open to speculation. The grouping of Helicogonium species with Hemiascomycetes, based mainly on their structural simplicity and yeast-like budding of the ascospores, may not be justified. The literature abounds with well-documented examples of structurally simplified members of otherwise complex taxa. Relationships within Helicogonium are also unclear. Axenic cultures are not obtained for any of the species and genetic sequences have yet to be elucidated. The production of secondary spores from ascospores is widespread among ascomycetes. Species of Helicogonium and many other fungi can also produce such spores directly in the ascus through processes resembling conidiogenesis. Species of Helicogonium are most commonly collected on hosts growing in dry situations, such as dead branches still attached to the tree, or on drying herbaceous stems.},

Drawing on evidence from paleoecological observations, recent phenological and microevolutionary responses, experiments, and computational models, we review the insights that different approaches bring to anticipating and managing the biodiversity consequences of climate change, including the extent of species' natural resilience. We introduce a framework that uses information from different sources to identify vulnerability and to support the design of conservation responses. Although much of the information reviewed is on species, our framework and conclusions are also applicable to ecosystems, habitats, ecological communities, and genetic diversity, whether terrestrial, marine, or fresh water.},

This chapter discusses the genus Filobasidiella. It provides a systematic discussion of the species and concludes with comments on the genus. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. The genus Filobasidiella is presently composed of two distinct groups: one group with an anontogenic budding yeast stage and another group without a budding yeast stage. The genus is unique among the Basidiomycota in many respects. It is the only basidiomycetous genus that contains human pathogens that produce life-threatening infections of the central nervous system in immuno-compromised as well as immuno-competent patients. Second, the species produce long chains of basidiospores on the apex of the holobasidia by repetitive basipetal budding; and third, the genus contains two groups of species, one with and one without ontogenic yeast states. Interestingly, the organization of 5S rRNA is different between the species with and without the ontogenic yeast state. While the 5S rRNA gene is embedded in the nontranscribed spacer regions of the rRNA repeat unit in the species with an ontogenic yeast state, as is the case with other Basidiomycetous species, the 5S rRNA gene is dispersed throughout the genome in F.depauperata like in some species in Ascomycetes. The two heterothallic species of Filobasidiella are unique in the size and genetic composition of the mating type loci. Filobasidiella was originally classified in the order Filobasidiales based on the morphology of basidial structures and their anamorphs.},

The blastoconidia are freed by an end-break in the stalk-like conidiophores without forceful ejection. True hyphae may or may not be produced. Ballistoconidia are not formed. Sexual reproduction is unknown. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Fellomyces polyborus. The key characters of species assigned to the genus Fellomyces are also discussed. In the systematic discussion of the species, growth on malt extract agar, growth in malt extract, Dalmau plate culture on corn meal agar, gene sequence accession numbers, type strain, origin of the strains studied, and systematics are determined.},

This chapter discusses the genus Holtermannia. It provides a systematic discussion of the species and concludes with comments on the genus. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. In asexual reproduction basidiospores germinate by yeast cells or ballistoconidia. Budding is polar, enteroblastic, and with sympodial proliferation. The yeast state is similar to that of Tremella and Cryptococcus species. In sexual reproduction mating and a hyphal phase occur when compatible pairs of yeast strains are mixed. The compatibility system is similar to that in Tremella spp., the production of complementary pheromones is controlled by alleles, and control of stable clamped dikaryotic hyphae is by multiple alleles. In the natural habitat, the dikaryotic mycelium grows in association with carbonaceous fungal stromata. The corniform basidiocarps are narrowly clavate and are often slightly compressed. The basidiocarps are simple or infrequently branched and typically occur in aggregates that often arise from such stromata. The tertiary hyphae have clamp connections, and hyphae adjacent to the associated stromatic surface bear infrequent complex haustorial branches. The basidiocarps sometimes appear to have a single branch because of anastomosis with another closely situated basidiome. The order Holtermanniales is created to accommodate Holtermannia corniformis and five anamorophic Holtermaniella species, four of which are currently classified as Cryptococcus, namely C. nyarrowii, C. festucosus, C. mycelialis, and C. watticus.},

This chapter studies the genus Endomyces. In the determination of asexual reproduction, colonies on natural substrates are white, floccose, pseudohyphal, or with septate hyphae. Blastoconidia, if present, are sympodially produced in short chains. In sexual reproduction it is seen that asci are subglobose to clavate, thin-walled, and open by rupture at the apex. Ascospores are 2{\textendash}12 per ascus, hyaline, ellipsoidal, or unilaterally flattened and helmet-shaped in outline due to a unilateral slimy brim. Species are homothallic and are parasitic on mushrooms. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that physiological growth characteristics have not been studied. The chapter further examines the phylogenetic placement. The type of species mentioned is Endomyces decipiens. The species accepted are Endomyces cortinarii, Endomyces decipiens, Endomyces polyporicola, and Endomyces scopularum. The systematic discussion of the species includes colonies on natural substrates, formation of ascospores, fermentation, growth, CoQ, Mol\% G1C, gene sequence accession numbers, type strain, cell carbohydrates, origin of the strain studied, type specimen, and systematics.},

The 100th anniversary of the British Ecological Society in 2013 is an opportune moment to reflect on the current status of ecology as a science and look forward to high-light priorities for future work.

* To do this, we identified 100 important questions of fundamental importance in pure ecology. We elicited questions from ecologists working across a wide range of systems and disciplines. The 754 questions submitted (listed in the online appendix) from 388 participants were narrowed down to the final 100 through a process of discussion, rewording and repeated rounds of voting. This was done during a two-day workshop and thereafter.

* The questions reflect many of the important current conceptual and technical pre-occupations of ecology. For example, many questions concerned the dynamics of environmental change and complex ecosystem interactions, as well as the interaction between ecology and evolution.

* The questions reveal a dynamic science with novel subfields emerging. For example, a group of questions was dedicated to disease and micro-organisms and another on human impacts and global change reflecting the emergence of new subdisciplines that would not have been foreseen a few decades ago.

* The list also contained a number of questions that have perplexed ecologists for decades and are still seen as crucial to answer, such as the link between population dynamics and life-history evolution.

* Synthesis. These 100 questions identified reflect the state of ecology today. Using them as an agenda for further research would lead to a substantial enhancement in understanding of the discipline, with practical relevance for the conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem function.},

The medically significant yeasts comprise more genera than the traditionally held pathogens in the genera Candida and Cryptococcus. Clinically important yeast forms can also be found among the endemic dimorphic fungi, the dematiaceous molds, and even a noncultureable fungus. Collectively, these fungal pathogens exhibit either teleomorphs of the ascomycota or basidiomycota, or their anamorphic forms express morphological and genetic features consistent with one of these taxa. They comprise a diverse spectrum of fungi that have found the means, primarily by exploiting a host organism's weakened immune system, to become noteworthy mycotic agents. Furthermore, they portend the potential for the spectrum of fungal pathogens to become wider and deeper in the number of etiological agents derived from normally benign species. Vigilance by the general as well as the medical mycologist must be maintained to better understand how to address the future challenges likely to be posed to public health by fungi, particularly the yeasts.},

This chapter studies the genus Peterozyma. In the determination of the asexual reproduction, it is seen that yeast cells arise by multilateral budding on a narrow base and are predominantly ovoid in shape. Pseudohyphae are abundant, well branched, and form blastoconidia, but true hyphae are not produced. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Peterozyma toletana. In the systematic discussion of the species, synonyms, growth on 5\% malt extract agar, growth on the surface of assimilation media, Dalmau plate culture on morphology agar, formation of ascospores, gene sequence accession number, type strain, origin of the strains studied, ecology, and biotechnology are determined.},

No specific single marker, either morphological or molecular, has been identified to distinguish the two species until now. In the present study morphoanatomical and molecular traits (simple sequence repeats = SSR loci) were investigated in an attempt to characterize and to discriminate between these two oak species. At the morphological level, the applied statistics (nested ANOVA and discriminant analysis) suggest that the micromorphological features are the most effective for this purpose. The wide range of macromorphological variation observed can confound the classification of many individuals into either Q. petraea and Q. pubescens. Analysis of microsatellite data indicates that most of the genetic variation is contained within, rather than between, species. The lack of molecular divergence could be attributed to either relatively rapid and recent differentiation or to extensive hybridization following secondary contact of the taxa.Copyright 2000 Annals of Botany Company},

This chapter studies the genus Torulaspora. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that cell division is by multilateral budding on a narrow base and budded cells are spherical to ellipsoidal. Pseudohyphae may be present, but true hyphae are not formed. In sexual reproduction it is found that the asci are persistent and may be unconjugated or show conjugation between a cell and its bud or between independent cells. Cells with tapered protuberances resembling conjugation tubes are often present. Asci contain one to four spherical ascospores that are either roughened or smooth. Some species are homothallic but others are heterothallic. The type species taken is Torulaspora delbrueckii. In Torulaspora the cells are predominantly haploid, with ascosporulation usually preceded by conjugation between independent cells or between a cell and its bud; ascospores are usually roughened; fermentation is vigorous; and the coenzyme is Q-6.},

We observed a surprising level of nucleotide divergence in transcriptionally silenced regions in inter-species comparisons of Saccharomyces yeasts. Likewise, intra-species analysis of polymorphisms also revealed increased SNP frequencies in both intergenic and synonymous coding positions of silenced DNA.

	abstract = {Background
Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been associated with human life for millennia in the brewery and bakery. Recently it has been recognized as an emerging opportunistic pathogen. To study the evolutionary history of S. cerevisiae, the origin of clinical isolates and the importance of a virulence-associated trait, population genetics and phenotypic assays have been applied to an ecologically diverse set of 103 strains isolated from clinics, breweries, vineyards, fruits, soil, commercial supplements and insect guts.

Methodology/Principal Findings
DNA sequence data from five nuclear DNA loci were analyzed for population structure and haplotype distribution. Additionally, all strains were tested for survival of oxidative stress, a trait associated with microbial pathogenicity. DNA sequence analyses identified three genetic subgroups within the recombining S. cerevisiae strains that are associated with ecology, geography and virulence. Shared alleles suggest that the clinical isolates contain genetic contribution from the fruit isolates. Clinical and fruit isolates exhibit high levels of recombination, unlike the genetically homogenous soil isolates in which no recombination was detected. However, clinical and soil isolates were more resistant to oxidative stress than any other population, suggesting a correlation between survival in oxidative stress and yeast pathogenicity.

Conclusions/Significance
Population genetic analyses of S. cerevisiae delineated three distinct groups, comprising primarily the (i) human-associated brewery and vineyard strains, (ii) clinical and fruit isolates (iii) and wild soil isolates from eastern U.S. The interactions between S. cerevisiae and humans potentiate yeast evolution and the development of genetically, ecologically and geographically divergent groups.},

Together with Celera Assembler, MHAP was used to reconstruct the genomes of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, Drosophila melanogaster, and human from high-coverage SMRT sequencing. The resulting assemblies include fully resolved chromosome arms and close persistent gaps in these important reference genomes, including heterochromatic and telomeric transition sequences. For D. melanogaster, MHAP achieved a 600-fold speedup relative to prior methods and a cloud computing cost of a few hundred dollars.

	abstract = {The beneficial substitution of an allele shapes patterns of genetic variation at linked sites. Thus, in principle, adaptations can be mapped by looking for the signature of directional selection in polymorphism data. In practice, such efforts are hampered by the need for an accurate characterization of the demographic history of the species and of the effects of positive selection. In an attempt to circumvent these difficulties, researchers are increasingly taking a purely empirical approach, in which a large number of genomic regions are ordered by summaries of the polymorphism data, and loci with extreme values are considered to be likely targets of positive selection. We evaluated the reliability of the "empirical" approach, focusing on applications to human data and to maize. To do so, we considered a coalescent model of directional selection in a sensible demographic setting, allowing for selection on standing variation as well as on a new mutation. Our simulations suggest that while empirical approaches will identify several interesting candidates, they will also miss many--in some cases, most--loci of interest. The extent of the trade-off depends on the mode of positive selection and the demographic history of the population. Specifically, the false-positive rate is higher when directional selection involves a recessive rather than a co-dominant allele, when it acts on a previously neutral rather than a new allele, and when the population has experienced a population bottleneck rather than maintained a constant size. One implication of these results is that, insofar as attributes of the beneficial mutation (e.g., the dominance coefficient) affect the power to detect targets of selection, genomic scans will yield an unrepresentative subset of loci that contribute to adaptations.},

	abstract = {The primary transcripts, pre-mRNAs, of almost all protein-coding genes in higher eukaryotes contain multiple non-coding intervening sequences, introns, which must be precisely removed to yield translatable mRNAs. The process of intron excision, splicing, takes place in a massive ribonucleoprotein complex known as the spliceosome. Extensive studies, both genetic and biochemical, in a variety of systems have revealed that essential components of the spliceosome include five small RNAs-U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6, each of which functions as a RNA, protein complex called an snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein). In addition to snRNPs, splicing requires many non-snRNP protein factors, the exact nature and number of which has been unclear. Technical advances, including new affinity purification methods and improved mass spectrometry techniques, coupled with the completion of many genome sequences, have now permitted a number of proteomic analyses of purified spliceosomes. These studies, recently reviewed by Jurica and Moore, reveal that the spliceosome is composed of as many as 300 distinct proteins and five RNAs, making it among the most complex macromolecular machines known.

	abstract = {Comparative genomics provides a rapid means of identifying functional DNA elements by their sequence conservation between species. Transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) may constitute a significant fraction of these conserved sequences, but the annotation of specific TFBSs is complicated by the fact that these short, degenerate sequences may frequently be conserved by chance rather than functional constraint. To identify intergenic sequences that function as TFBSs, we calculated the probability of binding site conservation between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and its two closest relatives under a neutral model of evolution. We found that this probability is {\textless}5\% for 134 of 163 transcription factor binding motifs, implying that we can reliably annotate binding sites for the majority of these transcription factors by conservation alone. Although our annotation relies on a number of assumptions, mutations in five of five conserved Ume6 binding sites and three of four conserved Ndt80 binding sites show Ume6- and Ndt80-dependent effects on gene expression. We also found that three of five unconserved Ndt80 binding sites show Ndt80-dependent effects on gene expression. Together these data imply that although sequence conservation can be reliably used to predict functional TFBSs, unconserved sequences might also make a significant contribution to a species' biology.},

	abstract = {During meiosis, chromatin undergoes extensive changes to facilitate recombination, homolog pairing, and chromosome segregation. To investigate the relationship between chromatin organization and meiotic processes, we used formaldehyde-assisted isolation of regulatory elements (FAIRE) to map open chromatin during the transition from mitosis to meiosis in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We found that meiosis-induced opening of chromatin is associated with meiotic DSB hotpots. The positive association between open chromatin and DSB hotspots is most prominent 3 h into meiosis, when the early meiotic genes DMC1 and HOP1 exhibit maximum transcription and the early recombination genes SPO11 and RAD51 are strongly up-regulated. While the degree of chromatin openness is positively associated with the occurrence of recombination hotspots, many hotspots occur outside of open chromatin. Of particular interest, many DSB hotspots that fell outside of meiotic open chromatin nonetheless occurred in chromatin that had recently been open during mitotic growth. Finally, we find evidence for meiosis-specific opening of chromatin at the regions adjacent to boundaries of subtelomeric sequences, which exhibit specific crossover control patterns hypothesized to be regulated by chromatin.},

Achieving dramatically reduced cost with enhanced throughput and quality will require the seamless integration of scientific and technological effort across disciplines within biochemistry, chemistry, physics and engineering. The challenges include sample preparation, surface chemistry, fluorescent labels, optimizing the enzyme-substrate system, optics, instrumentation, understanding tradeoffs of throughput versus accuracy, and read-length/phasing limitations.

	abstract = {Few studies of global diversity gradients in plants exist, largely because the data are not available for all species involved. Instead, most global studies have focussed on vertebrates, as these taxa have historically been associated with the most complete data. Here, we address this shortfall by first investigating global diversity gradients in monocots, a morphologically and functionally diverse clade representing a quarter of flowering plant diversity, and then assessing congruence between monocot and vertebrate diversity patterns. To do this, we create a new dataset that merges biome-level associations for all monocot genera with country-level associations for almost all \~{}70,000 species. We then assess the evidence for direct versus indirect effects of this plant diversity on vertebrate diversity using a combination of linear regression and structural equation modelling (SEM). Finally, we also calculate overlap of diversity hotspots for monocots and each vertebrate taxon. Monocots follow a latitudinal gradient although with pockets of extra-tropical diversity, mirroring patterns in vertebrates. Monocot diversity is positively associated with vertebrate diversity, but the strength of correlation varies depending on the clades being compared. Monocot diversity explains marginal amounts of variance ({\textless}10\%) after environmental factors have been accounted for. However, correlations remain among model residuals, and SEMs apparently reveal some direct effects of monocot richness. Our results suggest that collinear responses to environmental gradients are behind much of the congruence observed, but that there is some evidence for direct effects of producer diversity on consumer diversity. Much remains to be done before broad-scale diversity gradients among taxa are fully explained. Our dataset of monocot distributions will aid in this endeavour.},

This chapter discusses the genus Agaricostilbum. It provides a systematic discussion of the species and concludes with comments on the genus. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology, and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. In asexual reproduction the statismospores germinate by budding. Monospore isolates presumably yield stable yeast states that propagate by budding. Multispore isolates typically also continue budding rather than becoming hyphal. In sexual reproduction Agaricostilbum species have small synnematoid basidiocarps. These arid white structures often occur in conspicuous clusters on dead, attached, or fallen palm litter or on an unknown species of Xanthorrhoea (Liliaceae) in the case of A.pulcherrimum. Agaricostilbum spp. differ from many other taxa with similar {\textquotedblleft}simple{\textquotedblright} septal pores and Ustilago-like basidia in that septate basidia are formed directly, i.e., teliospores and distinct probasidia are absent, and each basidial cell buds off statismospores repeatedly as in Ustilago spp. and allied taxa. They also differ from other groups with similar basidia in important details of nuclear division. The statismospores give rise to stable yeast states on culture media. Details of mating are not yet known.},

We review these areas of contention, and suggest that criticism has often been misplaced, resulting from confusion between what the models actually deliver and what users wish that they would express. Although improvements in data and methods will have some effect, the usefulness of these models is contingent on their appropriate use, and they will improve mainly via better awareness of their conceptual basis, strengths, and limitations.},

ITS RFLP and sequence revealed a specific group of related strains different from the specific profile of Sherry flor yeast caused by a 24 bp deletion in the ITS1 region described by Esteve-Zarzoso et al. (Antonie Van Leeuwenhoek 85:151-158, 2004). Interdelta typing, the most discriminative method, revealed a high diversity of Jura flor yeast strains and gathered strains in clusters unequally shared between the northern and southern part of the Jura vineyard. The assessment of phenotypic diversity among the isolated strains was investigated for three wine metabolites (ethanal, acetic acid, and sotolon) from micro scale velum tests. Except at an early stage of ageing, the production of these metabolites was not correlated to the five genetic groups obtained by interdelta typing, but correlated to the cellar where strains had been isolated. The different strains isolated in a cellar produced mostly one type of velum (thin or thick, grey or white); but thin and grey velums, recognized as responsible for high quality wines, were obtained more frequently for one of the five groups of delta genotypes.},

In this study, we characterized the hybrid genomes and the relatedness of the Eg8 industrial yeast strain and of 24 Saccharomyces cerevisiae/Saccharomyces kudriavzevii hybrid yeast strains used for wine making in France (Alsace), Germany, Hungary, and the United States. An array-based comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) profile of the Eg8 genome revealed a typical chimeric profile. Measurement of hybrids DNA content per cell by flow cytometry revealed multiple ploidy levels (2n, 3n, or 4n), and restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of 22 genes indicated variable amounts of S. kudriavzevii genetic content in three representative strains. We developed microsatellite markers for S. kudriavzevii and used them to analyze the diversity of a population isolated from oaks in Ard{\`e}che (France). This analysis revealed new insights into the diversity of this species. We then analyzed the diversity of the wine hybrids for 12 S. cerevisiae and 7 S. kudriavzevii microsatellite loci and found that these strains are the products of multiple hybridization events between several S. cerevisiae wine yeast isolates and various S. kudriavzevii strains. The Eg8 lineage appeared remarkable, since it harbors strains found over a wide geographic area, and the interstrain divergence measured with a ($\delta$$\mu$)2 genetic distance indicates an ancient origin. These findings reflect the specific adaptations made by S. cerevisiae/S. kudriavzevii cryophilic hybrids to winery environments in cool climates.},

This chapter studies the genus Moniliella. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that colonies are smooth or velvety and grayish to olivaceous black. Budding cells are ellipsoidal and are formed terminally on true hyphae that disarticulate at a later stage. Pseudohyphae and chlamydospores may be present. Cell walls are multilamellar. Hyphal septa possess dolipores, as far as has been investigated. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Moniliella acetoabutens. The key characters of species in the genus Moniliella are presented. In the systematic discussion of the species, growth on 4\% malt extract/0.5\% yeast extract agar, gene sequence accession number, type strain, origin of the strains studied, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, and agriculture and food are determined.},

	abstract = {The availability of detailed environmental data, together with inexpensive and powerful computers, has fueled a rapid increase in predictive modeling of species environmental requirements and geographic distributions. For some species, detailed presence/absence occurrence data are available, allowing the use of a variety of standard statistical techniques. However, absence data are not available for most species. In this paper, we introduce the use of the maximum entropy method (Maxent) for modeling species geographic distributions with presence-only data. Maxent is a general-purpose machine learning method with a simple and precise mathematical formulation, and it has a number of aspects that make it well-suited for species distribution modeling. In order to investigate the efficacy of the method, here we perform a continental-scale case study using two Neotropical mammals: a lowland species of sloth, Bradypus variegatus, and a small montane murid rodent, Microryzomys minutus. We compared Maxent predictions with those of a commonly used presence-only modeling method, the Genetic Algorithm for Rule-Set Prediction (GARP). We made predictions on 10 random subsets of the occurrence records for both species, and then used the remaining localities for testing. Both algorithms provided reasonable estimates of the species{\textquoteright} range, far superior to the shaded outline maps available in field guides. All models were significantly better than random in both binomial tests of omission and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was almost always higher for Maxent, indicating better discrimination of suitable versus unsuitable areas for the species. The Maxent modeling approach can be used in its present form for many applications with presence-only datasets, and merits further research and development.},

	abstract = {How populations that inhabit the same geographical area become genetically differentiated is not clear. To investigate this, we characterized phenotypic and genetic differences between two populations of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that in some cases inhabit the same environment but show relatively little gene flow. We profiled stress sensitivity in a group of vineyard isolates and a group of oak-soil strains and found several niche-related phenotypes that distinguish the populations. We performed bulk-segregant mapping on two of the distinguishing traits: the vineyard-specific ability to grow in grape juice and oak-specific tolerance to the cell wall damaging drug Congo red. To implicate causal genes, we also performed a chemical genomic screen in the lab-strain deletion collection and identified many important genes that fell under QTL peaks. One gene important for growth in grape juice and identified by both the mapping and the screen was SSU1, a sulfite-nitrite pump implicated in wine fermentations. The beneficial allele is generated by a known translocation that we reasoned may also serve as a genetic barrier. We found that the translocation is prevalent in vineyard strains, but absent in oak strains, and presents a post-zygotic barrier to spore viability. Furthermore, the translocation was associated with a fitness cost to the rapid growth rate seen in oak-soil strains. Our results reveal the translocation as a dual-function locus that enforces ecological differentiation while producing a genetic barrier to gene flow in these sympatric populations.},

Yet virtually nothing is known about population-genetic variation within these species, including the molecular-biological and genetic-model organism S. cerevisiae. Here we investigate the population-genetic variation and population structure of S. cerevisiae by sequencing the four loci CDC19, PHD1, FZF1 and SSU1 in 27 strains. Sequence analysis demonstrates a distinct population structure in S. cerevisiae, distinguishing strains collected from a Pennsylvanian oak forest and strains collected from vineyards, perhaps due to ecological rather than geographic factors. The low level of conflict observed between the gene trees estimated for each locus implies moderate recombination in nature. High polymorphism in the gene SSU1 provides evidence of diversifying selection on its protein product, a sulfite exporter, perhaps associated with the use of sulfur-based fungicides in vineyards. FZF1, encoding a transcription factor regulating the expression level of SSU1, displays even greater polymorphism. This, the first multilocus sequence study of population structure in natural isolates of S. cerevisiae, is the first study to demonstrate population structure within S. cerevisiae, and the first study to detect historical selection on a locus important to the natural history of wine yeast.},

This modification has several advantages, allowing (1) detection of admixture events farther back into the past, (2) inference of the population of origin of chromosomal regions, and (3) more accurate estimates of statistical uncertainty when linked loci are used. It is also of potential use for admixture mapping. In addition, we describe a new prior model for the allele frequencies within each population, which allows identification of subtle population subdivisions that were not detectable using the existing method. We present results applying the new methods to study admixture in African-Americans, recombination in Helicobacter pylori, and drift in populations of Drosophila melanogaster.

	abstract = {We investigate several questions concerning the inference of the distribution of fitness effects (DFE) of new mutations from the distribution of nucleotide frequencies in a population sample. If a fixed sequencing effort is available, we find that the optimum strategy is to sequence a modest number of alleles (approx. 10). If full genome information is available, the accuracy of parameter estimates increases as the number of alleles sequenced increases, but with diminishing returns. It is unlikely that the DFE for single genes can be reliably estimated in organisms such as humans and Drosophila, unless genes are very large and we sequence hundreds or perhaps thousands of alleles. We consider models involving several discrete classes of mutations in which the selection strength and density apportioned to each class can vary. Models with three classes fit almost as well as four class models unless many hundreds of alleles are sequenced. Large numbers of alleles need to be sequenced to accurately estimate the distribution's mean and variance. Estimating complex DFEs may therefore be difficult. Finally, we examine models involving slightly advantageous mutations. We show that the distribution of the absolute strength of selection is well estimated if mutations are assumed to be unconditionally deleterious.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter studies the genus Ambrosiozyma. In the determination of asexual reproduction, abundant formation of true hyphae with blastoconidia, multilateral budding yeast cells, and pseudohyphae are present. Hyphal septa have a central, plugged pore surrounded by a thickening of the wall (dolipore-like). In light microscopy, the plugged pore shows as a small dark dot in the middle of the septum. In sexual reproduction it is seen that asci are generally formed on the hyphae and produce one to four hat-shaped ascospores. Asci become deliquescent for most species. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that sugars are fermented, often slowly and weakly. Nitrate is assimilated by some species. The major ubiquinone is coenzyme Q-7. The diazonium blue B reaction is negative. The chapter further examines the phylogenetic placement. The type of species mentioned is Ambrosiozyma monospora. The species accepted are Ambrosiozyma ambrosiae, Ambrosiozyma angophorae, Ambrosiozyma cicatricose, Ambrosiozyma monospora, Ambrosiozyma philentoma, and Ambrosiozyma platypodis. The systematic discussion of the species includes growth in malt extract, growth on malt agar, Dalmau plate cultures on potato and corn meal agar media, formation of ascospores, CoQ, Mol \% G1C, gene sequence accession numbers, type strain, cell carbohydrates, origin of the strains studied, type strain, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

	abstract = {The possibility of pervasive weak selection at tens or hundreds of millions of sites across the genome, suggested by recent studies of silent site DNA sequence variation and divergence, raises the problem of the survival of the population in the face of the large genetic load that may result. Two alternative resolutions of this problem are presented for populations where recombination is sufficiently frequent that different sites under selection evolve independently. One invokes weak stabilizing selection, of the magnitude compatible with abundant silent site variability. This can be shown to produce only a modest genetic load, due to the effectiveness of even weak stabilizing selection in keeping the trait mean close to the optimum. The other invokes soft selection, whereby individuals compete for a limiting resource whose abundance determines the absolute fitness of the population. Weak purifying selection at a large number of sites produces only a small variance in fitness among individuals within the population, due to the fact that most sites are fixed rather than polymorphic. Even when it produces a large genetic load, it is compatible with the observations on fitness variance when selection is soft. It may be very difficult to distinguish between these two possibilities.},

The employment of two temperatures (10{\textdegree}C in addition to the more commonly used 30{\textdegree}C) resulted in the isolation of S. kudriavzevii and S. uvarum, two species that grow at low temperatures, in addition to S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus. A clear bias was found toward the bark of certain trees, particularly certain oak species. Very often, more than one Saccharomyces species was found in one locality and occasionally even in the same bark sample. Our evidence strongly suggests that (markedly) different growth temperature preferences play a fundamental role in the sympatric associations of Saccharomyces species uncovered in this survey. S. kudriavzevii was isolated at most of the sites sampled in Portugal, indicating that the geographic distribution of this species is wider than the distribution assumed thus far. However, the Portuguese S. kudriavzevii population exhibited important genetic differences compared to the type strain of the species that represents a Japanese population. In this study, S. kudriavzevii stands out as the species that copes better with low temperatures.},

Meiotic DNA breakage in Schizosaccharomyces pombe did not require Rad50 or Rad32, although the homologs Rad50 and Mre11 are required in Saccharomyces cerevisiae; these proteins are required for meiotic DNA break repair in both yeasts. DNA breakage required the S. pombe midmeiosis transcription factor Mei4, but the structurally unrelated midmeiosis transcription factor Ndt80 is not required for breakage in S. cerevisiae. Rhp51, Swi5, and Rad22 + Rti1 were required for full levels of DNA repair in S. pombe, as are the related S. cerevisiae proteins Rad51, Sae3, and Rad52. Dmc1 was not required for repair in S. pombe, but its homolog Dmc1 is required in the well-studied strain SK1 of S. cerevisiae. Additional proteins required in one yeast have no obvious homologs in the other yeast.

But recent neutral ecology theory suggests that species diversity can simply be the result of random sampling, due to finite population sizes and limited dispersal. Neutral models predict that species are not necessarily adapted to specific niches, but are functionally equivalent across a range of habitats. Here, we evaluate the ecology of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, one of the most important microbial species in human history. The artificial collection, concentration and fermentation of large volumes of fruit for alcohol production produce an environment in which S. cerevisiae thrives, and therefore it is assumed that fruit is the ecological niche that S. cerevisiae inhabits and has adapted to. We find very little direct evidence that S. cerevisiae is adapted to fruit, or indeed to any other specific niche. We propose instead a neutral nomad model for S. cerevisiae, which we believe should be used as the starting hypothesis in attempting to unravel the ecology of this important microbe.},

The two quantities of interest are R, the number of recombination events in the history of a sample of sequences, and RM, the number of recombination events that can be parsimoniously inferred from a sample of sequences. Formulas are derived for the mean and variance of R. In contrast to R, RM can be determined from the sample. Since no formulas are known for the mean and variance of RM, they are estimated with Monte Carlo simulations. It is found that RM is often much less than R, therefore, the number of recombination events may be greatly under-estimated in a parsimonious reconstruction of the history of a sample. The statistic RM can be used to estimate the product of the recombination rate and the population size or, if the recombination rate is known, to estimate the population size. To illustrate this, DNA sequences from the Adh region of Drosophila melanogaster are used to estimate the effective population size of this species.},

	abstract = {This study presents compelling evidence that recombination significantly increases the silent GC content of a genome in a selectively neutral manner, resulting in a highly significant positive correlation between recombination and "GC3s" in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Neither selection nor mutation can explain this relationship. A highly significant GC-biased mismatch repair system is documented for the first time in any member of the Kingdom Fungi. Much of the variation in the GC3s within yeast appears to result from GC-biased gene conversion. Evidence suggests that GC-biased mismatch repair exists in numerous organisms spanning six kingdoms. This transkingdom GC mismatch repair bias may have evolved in response to a ubiquitous AT mutational bias. A significant positive correlation between recombination and GC content is found in many of these same organisms, suggesting that the processes influencing the evolution of the yeast genome may be a general phenomenon. Nonrecombining regions of the genome and nonrecombining genomes would not be subject to this type of molecular drive. It is suggested that the low GC content characteristic of many nonrecombining genomes may be the result of three processes (1) a prevailing AT mutational bias, (2) random fixation of the most common types of mutation, and (3) the absence of the GC-biased gene conversion which, in recombining organisms, permits the reversal of the most common types of mutation. A model is proposed to explain the observation that introns, intergenic regions, and pseudogenes typically have lower GC content than the silent sites of corresponding open reading frames. This model is based on the observation that the greater the heterology between two sequences, the less likely it is that recombination will occur between them. According to this "Constraint" hypothesis, the formation and propagation of heteroduplex DNA is expected to occur, on average, more frequently within conserved coding and regulatory regions of the genome. In organisms possessing GC-biased mismatch repair, this would enhance the GC content of these regions through biased gene conversion. These findings have a number of important implications for the way we view genome evolution and suggest a new model for the evolution of sex.},

This chapter studies the genus Cyrenella. This monotypic genus includes an unusual cystobasidiomycete with conidia with broadly diverging branches resembling those of aquatic hyphomycetes, i.e., Ingoldian fungi. In the determination of asexual reproduction it is seen that yeast cells are ovoid or elongate and reproduce by multilateral or polar budding. Unicellular obovate, thin-walled conidia with narrow, divergent, flexible, apical appendages are also formed. True hyphae with clamp connections and spherical to ovoid teliospores are produced. Ballistoconidia are not formed. In sexual reproduction it is found that formation of a basidium from teliospore germination has not been observed. Therefore, Cyrenella is considered to represent an anamorphic genus. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken and the species accepted is Cyrenella elegans. In the systematic discussion of the species, growth on 5\% malt extract agar, Dalmau plate culture on corn meal agar, gene sequence accession number, type strain, origin of the strain studied, systematics, and ecology are determined.},

This chapter discusses the genus Tremella. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that yeast cultures of Tremella (and Sirobasidium) species predominantly are whitish to cream or light tan, unlike basidiocarps, i.e., they are mostly not distinguishable on the basis of color. In the sexual reproduction it is found that monobasidiospore isolates of heterothallic species bud, giving rise to yeast states in culture, and the mycelia typically develop only when compatible strains are paired. Pairing of suitable cells yields a rapid response to complementary pheromones; budding ceases, mating tubes develop and fuse, and the dikaryotic hyphal state is initiated. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The salient physiological characteristics of yeast states of Tremella and Holtermannia species are also presented. In the systematic discussion of the species growth of yeast state in 2\% glucose in yeast nitrogen base, growth of yeast state on 5\% malt agar, growth of yeast state as Dalmau culture on potato dextrose agar and 5\% malt, basidiocarps, gene sequence accession numbers, CBS 6965, ecology and distribution, and clinical importance are determined.},

This chapter studies the genus Citeromyces. In the determination of asexual reproduction, cells are spherical to ellipsoidal and arise by multilateral budding on a narrow base. Neither pseudohyphae nor true hyphae are produced. In sexual reproduction, it is seen that asci are persistent, thick-walled, and contain one or, infrequently, two roughened spherical ascospores. Asci arise from diploid cells or from conjugation between complementary mating types. In physiology and biochemistry, it is seen that sugars are fermented and nitrate is assimilated. The ubiquinone formed is coenzyme Q-8. The diazonium blue B reaction is negative. The chapter further examines the phylogenetic placement where Citeromyces is a member of a large clade that includes the genera Pachysolen and Kuraishia. The type of species mentioned is Citeromyces matritensis. The species accepted are Citeromyces matritensis and Citeromyces siamensis. The systematic discussion of the species includes growth on 5\% malt extract agar, growth on the surface of assimilation media, Dalmau plate culture on morphology agar, formation of ascospores, CoQ, Mol\% G1C, gene sequence accession numbers, type strain, cell carbohydrates, origin of the strains studied, complementary mating types, type strain, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

This chapter studies the genus Hyphopichia. In the determination of asexual reproduction, cell division is by multilateral budding on a narrow base. Cells are short, ellipsoidal, or elongate. Pseudohyphae and true hyphae may be formed. Colonies are tannish-white and butyrous to hyphal. In sexual reproduction it is seen that asci may be unconjugated or show conjugation between separate cells or between a cell and its bud. One to four hat-shaped ascospores are formed and are released by ascus deliquescence. One species is heterothallic but the mating system of the other species is unknown. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that glucose and other sugars are fermented, and many of the sugars and polyols in standard yeast growth tests are assimilated. This study further examines the phylogenetic placement. The type of species mentioned is Hyphopichia burtonii. The species accepted are Hyphopichia burtonii and Hyphopichia heimii. The systematic discussion of the species includes synonyms, growth on 0.5\% malt extract agar, growth on the surface of assimilation media, Dalmau plate culture on morphology agar, CoQ, Mol\% G1C, gene sequence accession number, type strain, cell carbohydrates, formation of ascospores, origin of the strains studied, complementary mating types, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

	abstract = {Previous studies of the pericentromeric region of the human X chromosome short arm (Xp) revealed an age gradient from ancient DNA that contains expressed genes to recent human-specific DNA at the functional centromere. We analyzed the finished sequence of this human genomic region to investigate its evolutionary history. Phylogenetic analysis of {\textgreater}1,500 alpha-satellite monomers from the region revealed the presence of five physical domains, each containing monomers from a distinct phylogenetic clade. The most distal domain contains long interspersed nucleotide element repeats that were active {\textgreater}35 million years ago, whereas the four proximal domains contain more recently active long interspersed nucleotide element repeats. An out-of-register, unequal recombination (i.e., crossover) detected at the edge of the X chromosome-specific alpha-satellite array (DXZ1) may reflect the most recent of a series of punctuating events during evolution that resulted in a proximal physical expansion of the X centromere. The first 18 kb of this array has 97-99\% pairwise identity among all 2-kb repeat units. To perform more detailed evolutionary comparisons, we sequenced the junction between the ancient DNA of Xp and the primate-specific alpha satellite in chimpanzee, gorilla, orangutan, vervet, macaque, and baboon. The striking conservation found in all cases supports the ancestral nature of the alpha satellite at this location. These studies demonstrate that the primate X centromere appears to have evolved through repeated expansion events occurring within the central, active region of centromeric DNA, with the newly added sequences then conferring centromere function.},

Ascospores are elongate and tapering at the ends, with a membrane encircling the long axis of the spore. Asci are persistent. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which glucose and other sugars are fermented, including xylose. Nitrate is not assimilated, biotin and thiamin are necessary for growth, and acetic acid is not produced. Extracellular starch is not produced and the diazonium blue B reaction is negative.

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the genus Nadsonia. In the determination of the asexual reproduction, it is found that cells are lemon-shaped, ovoid, or elongate. Asexual reproduction is by bud-fission at both poles; this process involves the formation of a bud-like structure on a wide neck. The bud is separated by the formation of a cross wall, followed by fission. Pseudohyphae are not formed; a few chains of elongate cells may be present. In sexual reproduction it is seen that two methods of ascospore formation are known. In the first, following heterogamic conjugation between a cell and its bud, the contents of the zygote move into another bud formed at the opposite end of the parent cell. This second bud is then delimited by a septum and becomes the ascus. In the second method, after heterogamic conjugation between a cell and its bud, the bud is normally delimited by a septum and the parent cell becomes the ascus. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Nadsonia fulvescens. The key characters of species assigned to the genus Nadsonia are presented. In the systematic discussion of the species, growth in 5\% malt extract, growth on 10\% malt agar, Dalmau plate culture on potato agar, formation of ascospores, gene sequence accession number, type strain, cell carbohydrates, origin of the strains studied, and ecology are determined.},

	abstract = {A highly sensitive and specific PCR-based method of monitoring 16S rRNA genes of Pseudomonas stutzeri was developed for searching P. stutzeri DNA in environmental samples. This monitoring was combined with a reliable and sensitive method for isolating P. stutzeri colony formers from soil and sediment, depending on their utilization of ethylene glycol, starch, and maltose. With these techniques, P. stutzeri populations (n = 2 to 170) were obtained from five of six sites giving positive PCR signals (including three marine sediment and two soil samples). The phylogenetic positions of isolates from the five sites, based on their 16S ribosomal DNA sequences, indicated that the environmental isolates were affiliated with different genomovars of P. stutzeri. Using the broad-host-range plasmid pNS1 with kanamycin and gentamicin resistance determinants as the transforming DNA, naturally transformable strains were identified among the isolates from all sites. For one population from soil, the genetic relationship of the 120 members was determined by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR with three PCR primers. Among the population members which are taxonomically closely related as determined by 16S sequence comparisons of group representatives, a rather high genetic diversity and a characteristic clustering into subgroups were found. Remarkably, within the population, nontransformability and different levels of transformability (a frequency between about 10-9 and 10-4 per cell) were often associated with distinct genetic subgroups. It is concluded that transformability is widespread among environmental P. stutzeri strains and that its specific level is a heritable trait that may vary strongly within a local population.},

Although a number of regulatory sequences involved in both processes are known, it is not clear how general their functions are in the genomic context, nor how the regulatory regions are distributed throughout the genome. Here we study the distribution of known mutagenic elements within human introns and exons to deduce the properties of regions essential for splicing and transcription. We show that intronic splicing regulators are generally found close to the splice sites, but may be found as far as 200 nucleotides away from the splice junctions. Similarly, sequences important for splicing may be located as far as 125 nucleotides away from the junctions, within exons. We characterize several types of simple repetitive sequences and low-complexity regions that are overrepresented close to both intron ends and are likely to play important roles in the splicing process. We show that the first introns within most genes play a particularly important regulatory role that is most likely, however, to be involved in transcription control. We also study the distribution of two known regulatory motifs, the GGG trinucleotide and the CpG dinucleotide, and deduce their respective importance to splicing and transcription regulation.},

Only a few naturally segregating genetic differences associated with expression variation have been identified at the molecular level. We have identified a single nucleotide insertion in a vineyard isolate of Saccharomyces cerevisiae that has cascading effects through the gene-expression network. This allele is responsible for about 45\% (103/230) of the genes that show differential gene expression among the homozygous diploid progeny produced by a vineyard isolate. Using isogenic laboratory strains, we confirm that this allele causes dramatic differences in gene-expression levels of key genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis. The mutation is a frameshift mutation in a mononucleotide run of eight consecutive T's in the coding region of the gene SSY1, which encodes a key component of a plasma-membrane sensor of extracellular amino acids. The potentially high rate of replication slippage of this mononucleotide repeat, combined with its relatively mild effects on growth rate in heterozygous genotypes, is sufficient to account for the persistence of this phenotype at low frequencies in natural populations.},

	note = {The claim that eukaryotic micro-organisms have global geographic ranges, constituting a significant departure from the situation with macro-organisms, has been supported by studies of morphological species from protistan kingdoms. Here, we examine this claim by reviewing examples from another kingdom of eukaryotic microbes, the Fungi. We show that inferred geographic range of a fungal species depends upon the method of species recognition. While some fungal species defined by morphology show global geographic ranges, when fungal species are defined by phylogenetic species recognition they are typically shown to harbour several to many endemic species. We advance two non-exclusive reasons to explain the perceived difference between the size of geographic ranges of microscopic and macroscopic eukaryotic species when morphological methods of species recognition are used. These reasons are that microbial organisms generally have fewer morphological characters, and that the rate of morphological change will be slower for organisms with less elaborate development and fewer cells. Both of these reasons result in fewer discriminatory morphological differences between recently diverged lineages. The rate of genetic change, moreover, is similar for both large and small organisms, which helps to explain why phylogenetic species of large and small organisms show a more similar distribution of geographic ranges. As a consequence of the different rates in fungi of genetic and morphological changes, genetic isolation precedes a recognizable morphological change. The final step in speciation, reproductive isolation, also follows genetic isolation and may precede morphological change.},

When compared to mainland areas, oceanic islands in general are known for their high percentage of endemic species but only moderate levels of species richness, prompting the question of their relative conservation value. Here we quantify geographic patterns of endemism-scaled richness ({\textquotedblleft}endemism richness{\textquotedblright}) of vascular plants across 90 terrestrial biogeographic regions, including islands, worldwide and evaluate their congruence with terrestrial vertebrates. Endemism richness of plants and vertebrates is strongly related, and values on islands exceed those of mainland regions by a factor of 9.5 and 8.1 for plants and vertebrates, respectively. Comparisons of different measures of past and future human impact and land cover change further reveal marked differences between mainland and island regions. While island and mainland regions suffered equally from past habitat loss, we find the human impact index, a measure of current threat, to be significantly higher on islands. Projected land-cover changes for the year 2100 indicate that land-use-driven changes on islands might strongly increase in the future. Given their conservation risks, smaller land areas, and high levels of endemism richness, islands may offer particularly high returns for species conservation efforts and therefore warrant a high priority in global biodiversity conservation in this century.},

Local adaptation is thought to be a driving force in population differentiation and the formation of new species. Yet, there are few examples of ecologically relevant phenotypes that have been mapped to individual genes, making it difficult to know what drives the evolution of such genes and contributes to the molecular mechanisms underlying divergence. Here, we provide a unique case of local adaptation through multi-gene loss. We mapped the genetic basis for natural variation in yeast freeze-thaw tolerance to two water transporters, AQY1 and AQY2. Although tolerant strains harbor functional alleles of both genes, the set of sensitive strains lost aquaporins at least 6 independent times, through missense mutations and frame-shifting deletions. Genome-wide scans reveal several signatures of recent, partial selective sweeps at the aquaporin loci, indicating positive selection for gene loss. This was likely driven by a major fitness advantage of aquaporin loss when cells grow in high sugar concentrations common to many strains' niche. Surprisingly, strains that lost aquaporins also lost the ancestral requirement for these genes during sexual reproduction. This work provides a compelling example of how gene loss through nonsense mutations, a hallmark of pseudogenization, is caused not by loss of constraint but by positive selection.},

Cells divide by fission and are typically found in short chains of two to four cells, measuring up to 80 $\mu$m in length. In culture, the organism grows in short chains that extend longitudinally and laterally. In sexual reproduction it is not demonstrated. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Macrorhabdus ornithogaster. The events that led to the proof that the organism now known as Macrorhabdus ornithogaster is a fungus began when it was shown that the organism was not sensitive to antibacterial antibiotics but was sensitive to amphotericin B.},

This chapter discusses the genus Cuniculitrema. It provides a systematic discussion of the species and concludes with comments on the genus. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. In asexual reproduction yeast cells are ovoid to elongate, and budding is predominantly polar. Ballistonidia are not formed. Cultures can be cream colored or pale orange. In sexual reproduction hyphae have clamp connections and a {\textquotedblleft}simple{\textquotedblright} septal pore. Colacosomes are not produced. Spherical teliospores are formed, and when they germinate a holobasidium is formed. Sessile, ovoid to bacilliform basidiospores are passively released and germinate by budding. The genus Curvibasidium was erected to accommodate the sexual state of Rhodotorula fujisanensis (C. cygneicollum). The distinctive features of Curvibasidium are the production of teliospores and their germination by means of aholobasidium. The formation of a nonseptate basidium is a unique feature for the Pucciniomycotina. The basidiospores are sessile and germinate by budding. A second species, C. pallidicorallinum, is closely related but not identical to Rh. nothofagi. Based on phylogenetic analyses of sequence data, the closest relative of Curvibasidium is Leucosporidium fasciculatum.},

The results demonstrate that internal transcribed spacer (ITS) PCR-RFLP analysis with the endonucleases HaeIII, HpaII, ScrFI and TaqI is useful for discriminating S. cerevisiae, S. kudriavzevii, S. mikatae from one another and from the S. bayanus/S. pastorianus and S. cariocanus/S. paradoxus pairs. The sorghum beer strains exhibited the same restriction patterns as the type culture of S. cerevisiae CBS 1171. PCR profiles generated with the microsatellite primer (GTG)5 and the universal primer N21 were almost identical for all isolates and strain CBS 1171. Despite phenotypic peculiarities, the strains involved in sorghum beer production in Ghana and Burkina Faso belong to S. cerevisiae.

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the teleomorphic and anamorphic ascomycetous yeasts and yeast-like taxa. The relationship of ascomycetous yeasts with other members of the ascomycete fungi (Ascomycota) has been controversial. Because yeasts are morphologically simple, it was initially proposed that they represent primitive forms of ascomycetes. The idea then arose that yeasts represent morphologically reduced forms of more evolved taxa. The question of relationships among the ascomycetes remained uncertain until the use of gene sequence analyses to estimate phylogeny became established. Walker (1985) sequenced 5S rRNA for selected ascomycetes, and the analysis of this dataset, although small, divided the Ascomycota into three groups: Schizosaccharomyces and Protomyces, budding yeasts, and {\textquotedblleft}filamentous fungi.{\textquotedblright} The finding from single gene analyses that the Ascomycota is comprised of three separate lineages was supported by multigene sequence analyses. Nearly all of the teleomorphic clades to be discussed include species of Candida. The genus Candida has been a {\textquotedblleft}dumping ground{\textquotedblright} for budding yeasts that do not form ascospores, and it represents a polyphyletic group of species. With the introduction of sequence analysis, many species of Candida have been placed in teleomorphic clades, but others are in clades with no known ascosporic states. For this latter group, the division of Candida into a large number of named anamorphic genera, even though phylogenetically circumscribed, has little appeal because most of the genera will be unrecognized from the phenotype.},

This chapter studies the genus Sugiyamaella. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that yeast cells arise from multilateral budding and through formation of blastoconidia, often on denticulate condiogenous cells. The yeast cells are spherical, ellipsoidal, or elongate and sometimes tapered. Pseudohyphae and true hyphae are commonly formed. In sexual reproduction it is found that the known species are heterothallic and naturally occurring isolates may be ascosporogenous diploids or haploid mating types. Asci are globose to ovoid, usually arise on hyphae, and for some species have an apical cap cell. Asci are persistent and usually form a single ascospore. Ascospores may be ellipsoidal or bacilliform. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which sugars may be fermented and some species assimilate nitrate. The ubiquinone formed is CoQ-9 and the diazonium blue B reaction is negative. The type species taken is Sugiyamaella smithiae.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter studies the genus Cephaloascus. In the determination of asexual reproduction, budding cells are usually present; pseudohyphae and true hyphae are prevalent. Blastoconidia are formed sympodially in short chains on large denticles; terminal blastoconidia are clavate. Colonies are smooth or farinose and white to pale cream-colored. In sexual reproduction, it is seen that ascophores are erect, hyaline or brown, and bear a cluster of asci at their apex. Asci arise in short, branched chains, are ellipsoidal, thin-walled, and open by apical deterioration; asci usually contain four hat-shaped ascospores. In physiology and biochemistry, it is seen that sugars may be weakly fermented. Nitrate is not assimilated. Coenzyme Q-9 is formed. The diazonium blue B reaction is negative. The chapter further examines the phylogenetic placement. The type of species mentioned is Cephaloascus fragrans. The species accepted are Cephaloascus albidus and Cephaloascus fragrans. The systematic discussion of the species includes growth on 4\% malt extract/0.5\% yeast extract agar, growth on the surface of assimilation media, formation of ascospores, CoQ, Mol\% G1C, gene sequence accession number, type strain, cell carbohydrates, origin of the strain studied, complementary mating types, type strain, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter studies the genus Protomyces. In the determination of the asexual reproduction, it is seen that cell division is by budding on a narrow base near the poles of the cell. The cells are ovoid to elongate, and elongate cells may be asymmetrical. Pseudohyphae and true hyphae are not formed in culture. In sexual reproduction it is found that the ascosporic state is confined to the tissue of infected plants. Heavy walled spherical structures, variously termed ascogenous cells, synasci, and {\textquotedblleft}chlamydospores,{\textquotedblright} are formed in infected tissue. The ascogenous cells germinate to form a vesicle (ascus) that in turn produces 50{\textendash}200 spherical or ellipsoidal ascospores. Ascospore release is through a slit in the vesicle. Ascospores germinate to form asaprophytic, yeast-like budding stage. Reinfection of the host seems only to occur by hyphae, which results following conjugation of compatible yeast cells. Where examined, species are heterothallic. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which sugars are not fermented, nitrate is assimilated by most species, carotenoid pigments are usually produced by yeast phase cells in culture, and formation of extracellular starch-like compounds is strong, weak, or variable. The major ubiquinone is coenzyme Q-10 and the diazonium blue B reaction is negative. The type species taken is Protomyces macrosporus.},

Recent advances in genetics and genomics have brought unprecedented insights into the domestication of many organisms and have opened new avenues for further improvements to be made. Yet, our ability to engineer biological systems is not without limits; genetic manipulation is often quite difficult. The budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, is not only one of the most powerful model organisms, but is also the premier producer of fermented foods and beverages around the globe. As a model system, it entertains a hefty workforce dedicated to deciphering its genome and the function it encodes at a rich mechanistic level. As a producer, it is used to make leavened bread, and dozens of different alcoholic beverages, such as beer and wine. Yet, applying the awesome power of yeast genetics to understanding its origins and evolution requires some knowledge of its wild ancestors and the environments from which they were derived. A number of surprisingly diverse lineages of S. cerevisiae from both primeval and secondary forests in China have been discovered by Wang and his colleagues. These lineages substantially expand our knowledge of wild yeast diversity and will be a boon to elucidating the ecology, evolution and domestication of this academic and industrial workhorse.},

	abstract = {DNA methylation is one of the major epigenetic modifications and has been involved in a number of biological processes in mammalian cells. Yeast is widely used as a model organism for studying cell metabolism, cell cycle regulation, and signal transduction. However, it remains controversial whether methylated cytosine (5-methylcytosine, 5mC) exists in the yeast genome. In the current study, we developed a highly sensitive method based on gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and systematically examined the incidence of 5mC in 19 yeast strains, which represent 16 yeast species. Our results showed that DNA methylation is widespread in yeast and the genome-wide DNA methylation of the studied yeast strains ranged from 0.014 to 0.364\%, which were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower than that in mammalian cells (i.e., 3-8\%). Furthermore, we found that the 5mC content in yeast varied considerably at different growth stages and DNA methylation inhibitor 5-azacytidine could induce a decrease in genome-wide DNA methylation as that in mammalian cells. The demonstration of the universal presence of DNA cytosine methylation in yeast constituted the first and essential step toward understanding the functions of this methylation in yeast.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter studies the genus Dipodascopsis. In the determination of asexual reproduction, colonies are cream to white, moist, and somewhat slimy. Cells are spherical, ovoid, or occasionally elongated and divide by multilateral budding, mainly on a broad base. Budding may be abundant or sparse. Pseudohyphae may be present, and septate hyphae are formed, often abundantly by some species. In sexual reproduction it is seen that asci arise from conjugation between adjacent buds, hyphal tips, or fusion of a terminal hyphal cell with its penultimate cell. Asci are saccate, acicular, or cylindrical and may be persistent or deliquescent at the terminus. Ascospores number 4{\textendash}120 per ascus and are hyaline, spherical, ellipsoidal, or reniform and have a smooth wall without a slime sheath. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that fermentation is absent. Nitrate is not assimilated. Extracellular starch may be produced. Coenzyme Q has nine isoprene units in the side chain. The diazonium blue B reaction is negative. This study further examines the phylogenetic placement where Dipodascopsis is a sister genus of Lipomyces and its anamorph Myxozyma. The type of species mentioned is Dipodascopsis uninucleata. The species accepted are Dipodascopsis anomala, Dipodascopsis tothii, and Dipodascopsis uninucleata. The systematic discussion of the species includes synonyms, growth in malt extract, growth on malt agar, Dalmau plate cultures on potato agar, fermentation, formation of ascospores, CoQ, Mol\% G + C, gene sequence accession numbers, type strain, cell carbohydrates, origin of the strains studied, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

	abstract = {By using the maximum likelihood method, we made a genome-wide comparison of the evolutionary rates in the lineages leading to the laboratory strain (S288c) and a wild strain (YJM789) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found that genes in the laboratory strain tend to evolve faster than in the wild strain. The pattern of elevated evolution suggests that relaxation of selection intensity is the dominant underlying reason, which is consistent with recurrent bottlenecks in the S. cerevisiae laboratory strain population. Supporting this conclusion are the following observations: (i) the increases in nonsynonymous evolutionary rate occur for genes in all functional categories; (ii) most of the synonymous evolutionary rate increases in S288c occur in genes with strong codon usage bias; (iii) genes under stronger negative selection have a larger increase in nonsynonymous evolutionary rate; and (iv) more genes with adaptive evolution were detected in the laboratory strain, but they do not account for the majority of the increased evolution. The present discoveries suggest that experimental and possible industrial manipulations of the laboratory strain of yeast could have had a strong effect on the genetic makeup of this model organism. Furthermore, they imply an evolution of laboratory model organisms away from their wild counterparts, questioning the relevancy of the models especially when extensive laboratory cultivation has occurred. In addition, these results shed light on the evolution of livestock and crop species that have been under human domestication for years.},

Given that the environment is subjected to regular thunderstorms and lightning discharges that induce enormous electrical perturbations, the possibility of natural electrotransformation of bacteria was investigated. We demonstrated with soil microcosm experiments that the transformation of added bacteria could be increased locally via lightning-mediated current injection. The incorporation of three genes coding for antibiotic resistance (plasmid pBR328) into the Escherichia coli strain DH10B recipient previously added to soil was observed only after the soil had been subjected to laboratory-scale lightning. Laboratory-scale lightning had an electrical field gradient (700 versus 600 kV m[-]1) and current density (2.5 versus 12.6 kA m[-]2) similar to those of full-scale lightning. Controls handled identically except for not being subjected to lightning produced no detectable antibiotic-resistant clones. In addition, simulated storm cloud electrical fields (in the absence of current) did not produce detectable clones (transformation detection limit, 10[-]9). Natural electrotransformation might be a mechanism involved in bacterial evolution.},

While the molecular biology of certain fungi naturally associated with vines and wines is well characterized, complementary investigations into the ecology of fungi associated with fruiting plants is largely lacking. DNA sequencing technologies allow the direct estimation of microbial diversity from a given sample, avoiding culture-based biases. Here, we use deep community pyrosequencing approaches, targeted at the 26S rRNA gene, to examine the richness and composition of fungal communities associated with grapevines and test for geographical community structure among four major regions in New Zealand (NZ). We find over 200 taxa using this approach, which is 10-fold more than previously recovered using culture-based methods. Our analyses allow us to reject the null hypothesis of homogeneity in fungal species richness and community composition across NZ and reveal significant differences between major areas.},

This chapter studies the genus Pneumocystis. In the determination of the asexual reproduction, extracellular, obligate, host-specific, nonmycelial fungi that are restricted to mammalian lung tissues are seen. The fungi attach to Type I epithelial cells lining the aveoli and usually occur as clusters, which are composed of sexual and asexual developmental forms. A putative sexual cycle occurs after mating of trophic forms results in a diploid zygote that proceeds to form prototunicate asci, usually referred to as {\textquotedblleft}cysts.{\textquotedblright} The eight-spored spherical ascus-like cysts, which range in size from 8 to 10 $\mu$m, are the most characteristic form of Pneumocystis species. Meiosis and an additional mitotic division produce eight ascospores within an ascus. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Pneumocystis carinii. In the systematic discussion of the species, synonyms, asexual reproduction, sexual reproduction, clinical description, growth in RPMI1640 or Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM), growth temperature, gene sequence accession numbers, cell carbohydrates, neotype, systematics, ecology, and clinical importance are determined.},

The functional significance of this nongenic conservation remains unknown, however. The availability of the sequence of a third mammalian genome, the dog, allows for a large-scale analysis of evolutionary attributes of CNGs in mammals. We have aligned 1638 previously identified CNGs and 976 conserved exons (CODs) from human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) with their orthologous sequences in mouse and dog. Attributes of selective constraint, such as sequence conservation, clustering, and direction of substitutions were compared between CNGs and CODs, showing a clear distinction between the two classes. We subsequently performed a chromosome-wide analysis of CNGs by correlating selective constraint metrics with their position on the chromosome and relative to their distance from genes. We found that CNGs appear to be randomly arranged in intergenic regions, with no bias to be closer or farther from genes. Moreover, conservation and clustering of substitutions of CNGs appear to be completely independent of their distance from genes. These results suggest that the majority of CNGs are not typical of previously described regulatory elements in terms of their location. We propose models for a global role of CNGs in genome function and regulation, through long-distance cis or trans chromosomal interactions.},

This chapter studies the genus Lalaria. In the asexual reproduction budding cells are present and budding is unipolar or bipolar, with some similarities to that observed in basidiomycetous yeasts. Cells are globose, ovoid, ellipsoidal, or short-cylindrical. No true or pseudohyphae are formed. Colonies are cream, yellowish, or pinkish-cream, but old cultures may become more intensely pigmented. In sexual reproduction it is found that the Lalaria is the anamorphic genus of Taphrina. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which Lalaria species display a somewhat unusual combination of biochemical/physiological characteristics: production of urease, production of extracellular amyloid compounds, assimilation of nitrate, and negative diazonium blue reaction. Growth on common culture media may be slow. The type species taken is Lalaria populina. Moore created Lalaria in 1990 to accommodate yeast-phase anamorphs of the Taphrinales. Twenty-three species were then included in the genus, all represented by yeast states of previously recognized Taphrina species. The authenticity of many of the extant Taphrina cultures has been verified in recent molecular studies.},

Accurate species distribution models are useful for efficient and adaptive management and conservation, research, and ecological forecasting. Yet, these models are often presented without fully examining or explaining the caveats for their proper use and interpretation and are often implemented without understanding the limitations and assumptions of the model being used. We describe common pitfalls, assumptions, and caveats of correlative species distribution models to help novice users and end users better interpret these models. Four primary caveats corresponding to different phases of the modeling process, each with supporting documentation and examples, include: (1) all sampling data are incomplete and potentially biased; (2) predictor variables must capture distribution constraints; (3) no single model works best for all species, in all areas, at all spatial scales, and over time; and (4) the results of species distribution models should be treated like a hypothesis to be tested and validated with additional sampling and modeling in an iterative process.},

A new computer program called TBA (for "threaded blockset aligner") builds a threaded blockset under the assumption that all matching segments occur in the same order and orientation in the given sequences; inversions and duplications are not addressed. TBA is designed to be appropriate for aligning many, but by no means all, megabase-sized regions of multiple mammalian genomes. The output of TBA can be projected onto any genome chosen as a reference, thus guaranteeing that different projections present consistent predictions of which genomic positions are orthologous. This capability is illustrated using a new visualization tool to view TBA-generated alignments of vertebrate Hox clusters from both the mammalian and fish perspectives. Experimental evaluation of alignment quality, using a program that simulates evolutionary change in genomic sequences, indicates that TBA is more accurate than earlier programs. To perform the dynamic-programming alignment step, TBA runs a stand-alone program called MULTIZ, which can be used to align highly rearranged or incompletely sequenced genomes. We describe our use of MULTIZ to produce the whole-genome multiple alignments at the Santa Cruz Genome Browser.},

Yeasts have a rich history and a bright future in biotechnology. Their involvement and importance in traditional food fermentations are unparalled by other organisms of biotechnological relevance. The use of yeasts in biotechnological processes is accelerating due to a number of properties and developments. Most yeast species are nonpathogenic to humans and animals, and thus are anticipated to see more use in a variety of disciplines of importance to human activities. It is likely that yeasts will be increasingly used in traditional processes as their safety is more extensively established. S. cerevisiae and certain other species are being developed for the production of biofuels from cellulosic materials and potentially other substrates, and will have importance in the generation of new sources of energy. During the past decade, yeast systems have been developed for the production of heterologous proteins in high yields and with post-translational modifications equivalent or similar to modifications performed in humans. Yeasts are increasingly important as sources of biocatalysts for the production of high-value fine chemicals and protein pharmaceuticals. Due to their metabolic capabilities, they have important roles in environmental bioremediation.},

The mechanism that is responsible for this context-dependence of mutation rates is not understood. We demonstrate experimentally that frameshift mutation rates in yeast microsatellites depend on the genomic context and that this variation primarily reflects the context-dependence of the efficiency of DNA mismatch repair. We measured the stability of a 16.5-repeat polyGT tract by using a reporter gene (URA3-GT) in which the microsatellite was inserted in-frame into the yeast URA3 gene. We constructed 10 isogenic yeast strains with the reporter gene at different locations in the genome. Rates of frameshift mutations that abolished the correct reading frame of this gene were determined by fluctuation analysis. A 16-fold difference was found among these strains. We made mismatch-repair-deficient (msh2) derivatives of six of the strains. Mutation rates were elevated for all of these strains, but the differences in rates among the strains were substantially reduced. The simplest interpretation of this result is that the efficiency of DNA mismatch repair varies in different regions of the genome, perhaps reflecting some aspect of chromosome structure.},

Here we report the first chromosomal-level comparison examining the Alu retroposition dynamics following the divergence of humans and chimpanzees. We find a twofold increase in Alu insertions in humans in comparison to the common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes). The genomic diversity (polymorphism for presence or absence of the Alu insertion) associated with these inserts indicates that, analogous to recent nucleotide diversity studies, the level of chimpanzee Alu diversity is [{\textasciitilde}]1.7 times higher than that of humans. Evolutionarily recent Alu subfamily structure differs markedly between the human and chimpanzee lineages, with the major human subfamilies remaining largely inactive in the chimpanzee lineage. We propose a population-based model to account for the observed fluctuation in Alu retroposition rates across primate taxa.},

This chapter studies the genus Kockovaella. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that yeast cells are spherical, short ovoid, or kidney-shaped and reproduce by stalked conidia and ballistoconidia or, rarely, by budding cells. Stalks develop multilaterally and holoblastically from conidiogenous cells and, in rare cases, proliferate sympodially. The conidia are separated from the parent cells at the distal end of the stalk-like conidiophores. Ballistoconida are globose, napiform, kidney-shaped, or ellipsoidal. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Kockovaella thailandica. The salient characters among Kockovaella species are presented. In the systematic discussion of the species, growth on YM agar, growth in YM broth, growth on the surface of YM broth, Dalmau plate culture on corn meal agar, formation of ballistoconidia, gene sequence accession numbers, type strain, origin of the strain studied, and systematics are determined.},

Polymorphism detection is a key application. We describe general methods for improved quality scores and accurate automated polymorphism detection, and apply them to data from the Roche (454) Genome Sequencer 20. We assess our methods using known-truth data sets, which is critical to the validity of the assessments. 1. Improved quality scores. We developed informative, base-by-base error predictors for this sequencer and used a variant of the PHRED binning algorithm to combine them into a single empirically derived quality score. These quality scores are more useful than those produced by the system software: they both better predict actual error rates and identify many more high-quality bases. 2. Polymorphism detection. We developed a SNP detection method, with variants for low coverage, high coverage, and PCR amplicon applications, and evaluated it on known-truth data sets. We demonstrate good specificity in single reads, and excellent specificity (no false positives in 215 kb of genome) in high-coverage data. 10.1101/gr.070227.107},

We derive a maximal likelihood estimate of this distance from differences between lengths of orthologous introns or other segments of sequences delimited by conservative markers. When indels accumulate, lengths of orthologous introns diverge only slightly slower than linearly, because long indels occur with substantial frequencies. Thus, saturation is not a major obstacle for estimating indel-based evolutionary distance. For introns of medium lengths, our method recovers the known evolutionary distance between rat and mouse, 0.014 indels per site, with good precision. We estimate that mouse-human divergence exceeds rat-mouse divergence by a factor of 4, so that mouse-human evolutionary distance in terms of selectively neutral indels is 0.056. Because in mammals, indels are [{\textasciitilde}]14 times less frequent than nucleotide substitutions, mouse-human evolutionary distance in terms of selectively neutral substitutions is [{\textasciitilde}]0.8.},

This chapter studies the genus Wickerhamiella. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that multilateral budding occurs on either a narrow or a broad base. The cells are unusually small and range from spherical to ellipsoidal. Neither hyphae nor pseudohyphae are produced. In sexual reproduction it is found that the asci are conjugated and usually form a single, roughened ascospore. The spores are spherical to elongate, and a basal ring may be formed. Asci become deliquescent at the terminus, sometimes with a flanged tubular outgrowth. This chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which sugars are not fermented and nitrate is assimilated by most species. Pellicles are not formed on liquid media and the diazonium blue B reaction is negative. The type species taken is Wickerhamiella domercqiae. The cells of Wickerhamiella species are among the smallest known for yeasts. Equally unusual is the shape of the asci, which dissolve terminally for ascospore release. Wickerhamiella species are highly specialized nutritionally and ecologically. Their stricted physiology and the strong association with floricolous insects seem to be characteristic of most other members of the clade, which includes a number of Candida species that may eventually be found to form ascospores.},

Here, we report the complete molecular characterization of the C57BL/6J chromosome Y centromere, which comprises a highly diverged minor satellite-like sequence (designated Ymin) with higher-order repeat (HOR) sequence organization previously undescribed at mouse centromeres. The Ymin array is approximately 90 kb in length and resides within a single BAC clone that provides sequence information spanning an endogenous animal centromere for the first time. By exploiting direct patrilineal inheritance of the Y chromosome, we demonstrate stability of the Y centromere DNA structure spanning at least 175 inbred generations to beyond the time of domestication of the East Asian M.m. molossinus "fancy" mouse through which the Y chromosome was first introduced into the classical inbred laboratory mouse strains. Despite this stability, at least three unequal genetic exchange events have altered Ymin HOR unit length and sequence structure since divergence of the ancestral Mus musculus subspecies around 900,000 yr ago, with major turnover of the HOR arrays driving rapid divergence of sequence and higher-order structure at the mouse Y centromere. A comparative sequence analysis between the human and chimpanzee centromeres indicates a similar rapid divergence of the primate Y centromere. Our data point to a unique DNA sequence and organizational architecture for the mouse Y centromere that has evolved independently of all other mouse centromeres.},

Two general types of nuclear insertions coexist; one is characterized by long sequence stretches that are colinear with organelle DNA, the other type consists of mosaics of organelle DNA, often derived from both plastids and mitochondria. The levels of sequence divergence of the two types exclude their common descent, implying that at least two independent modes of DNA transfer from organelle to nucleus operate. The post-integration fate of organelle DNA is characterized by a predominance of transition mutations, associated with the gradual amelioration of the integrated sequence to the nucleotide composition of the host chromosome. Deletion of organelle DNA at these loci is essentially balanced by insertions of nonorganelle DNA. Deletions are associated with the removal of DNA between perfect repeats, indicating that they originate by replication slippage.},

Nine wild isolates and two lab strains of S. paradoxus were surveyed for sequence variation at six loci totaling 7 kb, and all 28 wild isolates were then genotyped at seven polymorphic loci. These data were used to calculate nucleotide diversity and number of segregating sites in S. paradoxus and to investigate geographic differentiation, population structure, and linkage disequilibrium. Synonymous site diversity is [{\textasciitilde}]0.3\%. Extensive incompatibilities between gene genealogies indicate frequent recombination between unlinked loci, but there is no evidence of recombination within genes. Some localized clonal growth is apparent. The frequency of outcrossing relative to inbreeding is estimated at 1.1\% on the basis of heterozygosity. Thus, all three modes of reproduction known in the lab (clonal replication, inbreeding, and outcrossing) have been important in molding genetic variation in this species.},

This chapter studies the genus Pseudozyma. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that yeast cells are variable in shape, fusoidal, ovoid, ellipsoidal, or somewhat cylindrical; hyphae occur, usually with retraction septa and with the cytoplasm retracted in cells separated by lysed cells; fusiform blastoconidia are formed on sterigma-like denticles and usually form an aerial mycelium made up of branched, acropetal chains of fusiform conidia; chlamydospores may be present; and ballistoconidia are absent. Sexual reproduction is unknown, but most likely many species of Pseudozyma represent anamorphic states of species belonging to Ustilaginales. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species accepted are Pseudozyma Antarctica, Pseudozyma aphidis, and so on. Key physiological characters of species in the genus Pseudozyma with Ustilago maydis as a reference are presented.

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter studies the genus Scheffersomyces. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that cell division is by multilateral budding on a narrow base, and budded cells are spherical to elongate. Pseudohyphae are formed, but true hyphae do not develop. In sexual reproduction it is found that the asci form following conjugation between a cell and its bud, between independent cells, or following pairing of complementary mating types. Thus, some species are homothallic and one species is heterothallic. Asci produce one or two hat-shaped ascospores that are released soon after formation. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which glucose is fermented as well as certain other sugars. Some of the species ferment D-xylose, which is important for biofuel production. Various sugars, polyols, and organic acids used for yeast identification are assimilated, but nitrate is not utilized. The major ubiquinone produced is CoQ-9, and the diazonium blue B test is negative. The type species taken is Scheffersomyces stipitis.},

	abstract = {Humans have had a significant impact on the distribution and abundance of Saccharomyces cerevisiae through its widespread use in beer, bread and wine production. Yet, similar to other Saccharomyces species, S.~cerevisiae has also been isolated from habitats unrelated to fermentations. Strains of S.~cerevisiae isolated from grapes, wine must and vineyards worldwide are genetically differentiated from strains isolated from oak-tree bark, exudate and associated soil in North America. However, the causes and consequences of this differentiation have not yet been resolved. Historical differentiation of these two groups may have been influenced by geographic, ecological or human-associated barriers to gene flow. Here, we make use of the relatively recent establishment of vineyards across North America to identify and characterize any active barriers to gene flow between these two groups. We examined S.~cerevisiae strains isolated from grapes and oak trees within three North American vineyards and compared them to those isolated from oak trees outside of vineyards. Within vineyards, we found evidence of migration between grapes and oak trees and potential gene flow between the divergent oak-tree and vineyard groups. Yet, we found no vineyard genotypes on oak trees outside of vineyards. In contrast, Saccharomyces paradoxus isolated from the same sources showed population structure characterized by isolation by distance. The apparent absence of ecological or genetic barriers between sympatric vineyard and oak-tree populations of S.~cerevisiae implies that vineyards play an important role in the mixing between these two groups.},

	abstract = {The disjunct distributions of morphologically similar plants between eastern Asia and eastern North America have fascinated botanists and biogeographers since the Linnaean era. This biogeographic pattern is currently recognized by the disjunct distributions of some species, approximately 65 genera, and a few closely related genera in these two widely separated areas. Early workers treated many disjuncts as conspecific, but most were later recognized as intercontinental species pairs. Recent phylogenetic studies confirm affinities between many of the disjunct taxa but also indicate that the disjunct pairs of species are rarely each other's closest relatives. Instead, a pattern of further diversification of species on one or both continents is commonly found. Phylogenetic, molecular, geologic, and fossil data all support the hypothesis that the eastern Asian and eastern North American disjunct distributions are relicts of the maximum development of temperate forests in the northern hemisphere during the Tertiary. Fossil and geologic evidence supports multiple origins of this pattern in the Tertiary, with both the North Atlantic and the Bering land bridges involved. In many genera of flowering plants, current estimates of divergence times using molecular and fossil data suggest that the disjunct patterns were established during the Miocene. Morphological stasis, evidenced by the minimal morphological divergence of species after a long time of separation, must have occurred in some of the disjunct groups in the north temperate zone.},

This genomic constitution may confer selective advantages in some environments. Different mechanisms of recombination, such as meiosis or mitotic rearrangement of chromosomes, have been proposed for wine strains. We studied the stability of the URA3 locus of a URA3/ura3 wine yeast in consecutive grape must fermentations. ura3/ura3 homozygotes were detected at a rate of 1 x 10[-]5 to 3 x 10[-]5 per generation, and mitotic rearrangements for chromosomes VIII and XII appeared after 30 mitotic divisions. We used the karyotype as a meiotic marker and determined that sporulation was not involved in this process. Thus, we propose a hypothesis for the genome changes in wine yeasts during vinification. This putative mechanism involves mitotic recombination between homologous sequences and does not necessarily imply meiosis.},

This chapter studies the genus Itersonilia. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that hyphae are hyaline, septate, and dikaryotic or, rarely, monokaryotic. Clamp connections are present in the dikaryophase, but incomplete clamps occur in monokaryotic hyphae. Inflated cells ({\textquotedblleft}sporogenouscells{\textquotedblright}) are globose, subglobose, pyriform, or ovoid, occur singly or in clusters, are terminal or intercalary, and are thin to somewhat thick-walled. Ballistoconidia are bilaterally symmetrical, lunate or, rarely, subpyriform, and form either by germination of inflated cells or assecondary ballistoconidia. Germinating ballistoconidia may give rise to appressoria. Itersonilia seems to have a tetrapolar mating system, and the life cycle comprises dikaryotic hyphae, monokaryotic hyphae, and yeast cells. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Itersonilia perplexans.

The selective methods employed utilize the non-mating property of strains disomic for linkage group III and heterozygous at the mating type locus. The principal findings are: (1) The frequency of spontaneous chromosome loss in the disome is of the order 10-4 per cell; this value approximates the frequency in the same population of spontaneous mitotic exchange resulting in homozygosity at the mating type locus. (2) The recovered diploids are pure clones, and thus represent unique events in the disomic haploid. (3) Of the euploid chromosomes recovered after events leading to chromosome loss, approximately 90\% retain the parental marker configuration expected from segregation alone; however, the remainder are recombinant for marker genes, and are the result of mitotic exchanges in the disome, especially in regions near the centromere. The recombinant proportion significantly exceeds that expected if chromosome loss and mitotic exchange in the disome were independent events. The data are consistent with a model proposing mitotic nondisjunction as the event responsible for chromosome loss in the disomic haploid.},

Previous work has shown that reproductive isolation between the species is due primarily to sequence divergence acted upon by the mismatch repair system and not due to major gene differences or chromosomal rearrangements. Sequence divergence through mismatch repair has also been shown to cause partial reproductive isolation among populations within a species. We have surveyed sequence variation in populations of Saccharomyces sensu stricto yeasts and measured meiotic sterility in hybrids. This allows us to determine the divergence necessary to produce the reproductive isolation seen among species. Rather than a sharp transition from fertility to sterility, which may have been expected, we find a smooth monotonic relationship between diversity and reproductive isolation, even as far as the well-accepted designations of S. paradoxus and S. cerevisiae as distinct species. Furthermore, we show that one species of Saccharomyces--S. cariocanus--differs from a population of S. paradoxus by four translocations, but not by sequence. There is molecular evidence of recent introgression from S. cerevisiae into the European population of S. paradoxus, supporting the idea that in nature the boundary between these species is fuzzy.},

	abstract = {Detection, identification and classification of yeasts have undergone a major transformation in the last decade and a half following application of gene sequence analyses and genome comparisons. Development of a database (barcode) of easily determined DNA sequences from domains 1 and 2 (D1/D2) of the nuclear large subunit rRNA gene and from ITS now permits many laboratories to identify species quickly and accurately, thus replacing the laborious and often inaccurate phenotypic tests previously used. Phylogenetic analysis of gene sequences is leading to a major revision of yeast systematics that will result in redefinition of nearly all genera. This new understanding of species relationships has prompted a change of rules for naming and classifying yeasts and other fungi, and these new rules are presented in the recently implemented International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (Melbourne Code). The use of molecular methods for species identification and the impact of Code changes on classification will be discussed, as will use of phylogeny for prediction of biotechnological applications.},

	abstract = {Background
The new generation of massively parallel DNA sequencers, combined with the challenge of whole human genome resequencing, result in the need for rapid and accurate alignment of billions of short DNA sequence reads to a large reference genome. Speed is obviously of great importance, but equally important is maintaining alignment accuracy of short reads, in the 25{\textendash}100 base range, in the presence of errors and true biological variation.

Methodology
We introduce a new algorithm specifically optimized for this task, as well as a freely available implementation, BFAST, which can align data produced by any of current sequencing platforms, allows for user-customizable levels of speed and accuracy, supports paired end data, and provides for efficient parallel and multi-threaded computation on a computer cluster. The new method is based on creating flexible, efficient whole genome indexes to rapidly map reads to candidate alignment locations, with arbitrary multiple independent indexes allowed to achieve robustness against read errors and sequence variants. The final local alignment uses a Smith-Waterman method, with gaps to support the detection of small indels.

Conclusions
We compare BFAST to a selection of large-scale alignment tools - BLAT, MAQ, SHRiMP, and SOAP - in terms of both speed and accuracy, using simulated and real-world datasets. We show BFAST can achieve substantially greater sensitivity of alignment in the context of errors and true variants, especially insertions and deletions, and minimize false mappings, while maintaining adequate speed compared to other current methods. We show BFAST can align the amount of data needed to fully resequence a human genome, one billion reads, with high sensitivity and accuracy, on a modest computer cluster in less than 24 hours. BFAST is available at http://bfast.sourceforge.net.},

Here we test whether gene conversion events are GC-biased in Drosophila melanogaster using whole genome polymorphism and divergence data. Our results provide no support for GC-biased gene conversion and thus suggest that this process is unlikely to significantly contribute to patterns of polymorphism and divergence in this system.},

Basidia form laterally on branches and apically on the hyphae. Basidia vary in shape from globose to subglobose and lageniform to ovoid with transverse and longitudinal to oblique septa. Navicular basidia have one to three transverse septa. The globose basidia occur singly, in pairs, or in chains. Basidiospores are globose, ovoid to cylindrical, and passively released. Ballistospores are not present. Diagnosis on the basis of physiology and biochemistry reveals that fermentation is absent. A brownish pigment is produced that diffuses into solid media.

This chapter studies the genus Kurtzmaniella. In the determination of asexual reproduction, cells are ovoid to ellipsoid and divide by multilateral budding. Poorly differentiated pseudohyphae are formed. In sexual reproduction it is seen that asci are conjugated and usually form two flattened, hat-shaped ascospores with a conspicuous basal ledge. This study further examines the physiology, biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. The type of species mentioned is Kurtzmaniella cleridarum. The species accepted is Kurtzmaniella cleridarum. The systematic discussion of the species includes synonyms, growth on YM agar, growth in glucose-yeast extract broth, Dalmau plate culture on corn meal, formation of ascospores, origin of the strains studied, type strain, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

This chapter studies the genus Mastigobasidium. In asexual reproduction cells are ovoid or elongate and reproduce by budding and ballistoconidia. Pseudohyphae and true hyphae occur. Clamp connections are absent. Colonies are smooth or delicately wrinkled and whitish, cream, or yellowish-gray. In sexual reproduction it is seen that true mycelium with clamp connections and teliospores occur after conjugation of a compatible pair of mating strains. After a resting period, the teliospores germinate to produce several long hyphae, and clavate, usually curved phragmometabasidia develop on the apices of these hyphae. Basidiospores, which form laterally or terminally, are ellipsoid to bacilliform and are either sessile or arise on pegs. Basidiospores occur singly or in clusters and germinate by budding. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that fermentation is absent. D-Glucuronate is assimilated. Nitrate is not assimilated. The major coenzyme Q has nine isoprene units in the side chain. Xylose is absent in extracellular polysaccharides. Urease and diazonium blue B reactions are positive. The type species mentioned and accepted is Mastigobasidium intermedium Golubev.},

	abstract = {Haploinsufficiency is defined as a dominant phenotype in diploid organisms that are heterozygous for a loss-of-function allele. Despite its relevance to human disease, neither the extent of haploinsufficiency nor its precise molecular mechanisms are well understood. We used the complete set of Saccharomyces cerevisiae heterozygous deletion strains to survey the genome for haploinsufficiency via fitness profiling in rich (YPD) and minimal media to identify all genes that confer a haploinsufficient growth defect. This assay revealed that [{\textasciitilde}]3\% of all [{\textasciitilde}]5900 genes tested are haploinsufficient for growth in YPD. This class of genes is functionally enriched for metabolic processes carried out by molecular complexes such as the ribosome. Much of the haploinsufficiency in YPD is alleviated by slowing the growth rate of each strain in minimal media, suggesting that certain gene products are rate limiting for growth only in YPD. Overall, our results suggest that the primary mechanism of haploinsufficiency in yeast is due to insufficient protein production. We discuss the relevance of our findings in yeast to human haploinsufficiency disorders.},

This chapter studies the genus Starmerella. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that cell division is by multilateral budding on a narrow base. The cells range from spherical to ellipsoidal. Neither hyphae nor pseudohyphae are produced. Pellicles are not formed on liquid media. In sexual reproduction it is found that the conjugated asci usually form a single, roughened, asymmetrical ascospore. Ascospores are released by rupture of the ascus at the terminus. The ascospore surface is corrugated, and a thin ledge may be present at the base. Species may be heterothallic or homothallic. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which glucose is fermented and nitrate assimilation varies among species. Coenzyme Q-9 is present and the diazonium blue B reaction is negative. The type species taken is Starmerella bombicola. The genus Starmerella was described to accommodate the sexual state of Candida bombicola. The latter species was known to be part of a cohesive group of strictly unicellular, nutritionally specialized species formerly assigned to the genus Torulopsis.},

However, in applications of the next-generation sequencing (NGS), accurate genotypes may not be easily obtained (e.g. multi-sample low-coverage sequencing or somatic mutation discovery). These applications press for the development of new methods for analyzing sequence data with uncertainty. RESULTS: We present a statistical framework for calling SNPs, discovering somatic mutations, inferring population genetical parameters and performing association tests directly based on sequencing data without explicit genotyping or linkage-based imputation. On real data, we demonstrate that our method achieves comparable accuracy to alternative methods for estimating site allele count, for inferring allele frequency spectrum and for association mapping. We also highlight the necessity of using symmetric datasets for finding somatic mutations and confirm that for discovering rare events, mismapping is frequently the leading source of errors.

This chapter discusses two important agricultural aspects of yeasts{\textemdash}control of plant diseases through application of yeasts as the control agent, and yeasts that are plant pathogens. Yeasts as biocontrol organisms are presented first, followed by a discussion of some of the more common plant pathogenic yeasts. In biocontrol, it is convenient to divide biotic diseases of plants into those in which the pathogen predominantly gains entrance to the plant via its underground parts versus those that infect aerial tissues of the plant. The vast majority of research on the biological control of plant diseases in the field using yeasts or yeast-like fungi has concentrated on diseases of above ground parts of plants. The potential of yeasts as biocontrol agents of soil-borne fungal plant pathogens is reviewed in the chapter. The use of yeasts to reduce decay on harvested commodities has also received considerable research attention. Application of yeasts for this purpose has been evaluated both as a pre- and as a postharvest treatment. Fruits are rich in easily utilizable carbon and are natural habitats for a variety of yeasts. Until recently, yeasts of grape and apple were studied most extensively because of their importance in vinification and making apple cider.},

	abstract = {Most microbes have complex life cycles with multiple modes of reproduction that differ in their effects on DNA sequence variation. Population genomic analyses can therefore be used to estimate the relative frequencies of these different modes in nature. The life cycle of the wild yeast Saccharomyces paradoxus is complex, including clonal reproduction, outcrossing, and two different modes of inbreeding. To quantify these different aspects we analyzed DNA sequence variation in the third chromosome among 20 isolates from two populations. Measures of mutational and recombinational diversity were used to make two independent estimates of the population size. In an obligately sexual population these values should be approximately equal. Instead there is a discrepancy of about three orders of magnitude between our two estimates of population size, indicating that S. paradoxus goes through a sexual cycle approximately once in every 1,000 asexual generations. Chromosome III also contains the mating type locus (MAT), which is the most outbred part in the entire genome, and by comparing recombinational diversity as a function of distance from MAT we estimate the frequency of matings to be approximately 94\% from within the same tetrad, 5\% with a clonemate after switching the mating type, and 1\% outcrossed. Our study illustrates the utility of population genomic data in quantifying life cycles.},

	abstract = {The present study uses a mathematical-empirical approach to estimate the cardinal growth temperature parameters (Tmin, the temperature below which growth is no longer observed; Topt, the temperature at which the $\mu$max equals its optimal value; $\mu$opt, the optimal value of $\mu$max; and Tmax, the temperature above which no growth occurs) of 27 yeast strains belonging to different Saccharomyces and non-Saccharomyces species. S. cerevisiae was the yeast best adapted to grow at high temperatures within the Saccharomyces genus, with the highest optimum (32.3{\textdegree}C) and maximum (45.4{\textdegree}C) growth temperatures. On the other hand, S. kudriavzevii and S. bayanus var. uvarum showed the lowest optimum (23.6 and 26.2{\textdegree}C) and maximum (36.8 and 38.4{\textdegree}C) growth temperatures, respectively, confirming that both species are more psychrophilic than S. cerevisiae. The remaining Saccharomyces species (S. paradoxus, S. mikatae, S. arboricolus, and S. cariocanus) showed intermediate responses. With respect to the minimum temperature which supported growth, this parameter ranged from 1.3 (S. cariocanus) to 4.3{\textdegree}C (S. kudriavzevii). We also tested whether these physiological traits were correlated with the phylogeny, which was accomplished by means of a statistical orthogram method. The analysis suggested that the most important shift in the adaptation to grow at higher temperatures occurred in the Saccharomyces genus after the divergence of the S. arboricolus, S. mikatae, S. cariocanus, S. paradoxus, and S. cerevisiae lineages from the S. kudriavzevii and S. bayanus var. uvarum lineages. Finally, our mathematical models suggest that temperature may also play an important role in the imposition of S. cerevisiae versus non-Saccharomyces species during wine fermentation.},

This chapter studies the genus Saccharomycodes. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that cells are lemon-shaped (apiculate) and divide by bipolar budding on a broad base (bud-fission). Pseudohyphae are absent or poorly developed. In sexual reproduction it is found that the ascospores are spherical; a narrow subequatorial ledge and irregularly spaced surface nodules may be visible, especially with the electron microscope. Asci contain one to four ascospores. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which sugars are fermented, nitrate is not assimilated, the diazonium blue B reaction is negative, and coenzyme Q-6 is formed. The type species taken is Saccharomycodes ludwigii. Saccharomycodes is a sister genus of Hanseniaspora. Multigene phylogenetic analysis placed these two genera basal to the Saccharomycetaceae, and they are classified in the family Saccharomycodaceae. Saccharomycodes and Hanseniaspora are characterized by bipolar budding, but they are not closely related to Wickerhamia and Nadsonia, which also divide by bipolar budding.},

Nevertheless, formidable technical barriers have constrained our understanding of the rate at which mutations arise and the molecular spectrum of their effects. Here, we report on the use of complete-genome sequencing in the characterization of spontaneously arising mutations in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Our results confirm some findings previously obtained by indirect methods but also yield numerous unexpected findings, in particular a very high rate of point mutation and skewed distribution of base-substitution types in the mitochondrion, a very high rate of segmental duplication and deletion in the nuclear genome, and substantial deviations in the mutational profile among various model organisms.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. RESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package. AVAILABILITY: http://maq.sourceforge.net.},

	abstract = {Centromeres are the site for kinetochore formation and spindle attachment and are embedded in heterochromatin in most eukaryotes. The repeat-rich nature of heterochromatin has hindered obtaining a detailed understanding of the composition and organization of heterochromatic and centromeric DNA sequences. Here, we report the results of extensive sequence analysis of a fully functional centromere present in the Drosophila Dp1187 minichromosome. Approximately 8.4\% (31 kb) of the highly repeated satellite DNA (AATAT and TTCTC) was sequenced, representing the largest data set of Drosophila satellite DNA sequence to date. Sequence analysis revealed that the orientation of the arrays is uniform and that individual repeats within the arrays mostly differ by rare, single-base polymorphisms. The entire complex DNA component of this centromere (69.7 kb) was sequenced and assembled. The 39-kb "complex island" Maupiti contains long stretches of a complex A+T rich repeat interspersed with transposon fragments, and most of these elements are organized as direct repeats. Surprisingly, five single, intact transposons are directly inserted at different locations in the AATAT satellite arrays. We find no evidence for centromere-specific sequences within this centromere, providing further evidence for sequence-independent, epigenetic determination of centromere identity and function in higher eukaryotes. Our results also demonstrate that the sequence composition and organization of large regions of centric heterochromatin can be determined, despite the presence of repeated DNA.

This chapter studies the genus Ascoidea. In the determination of asexual reproduction, colonies are smooth, moist or dry, mostly with an expanding, submerged mycelium. Species are often dimorphic, with colonies being restricted and yeast-like or expanding and hyphal. Budding cells and pseudohyphae are present or absent. Wide, true hyphae are present and form blastoconidia, which are sessile or inserted on denticles and occur singly or in short, branched chains. In sexual reproduction, it is seen that asci occur laterally or terminally on hyphae, ellipsoidal or acicular, with firm walls, and contain numerous ascospores, which are liberated through a terminal opening. New asci are formed percurrently inside the remains of a previous ascus. Ascospores are ellipsoidal, with a unilateral, mucilaginous brim. In physiology and biochemistry, it is seen that fermentation is absent. Urease activity is absent too. The diazonium blue B reaction is negative or, rarely, weak. This chapter further examines the phylogenetic placement. The type of species mentioned is Ascoidea rubescens. The species accepted are Ascoidea africana, Ascoidea hylecoeti, and Ascoidea rubescens. The systematic discussion of the species includes growth on 4\% malt extract agar, formation of ascospores, CoQ, Mol\% G1C, gene sequence accession number, type strain, cell carbohydrates, origin of the strains studied, type strain, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter studies the genus Kurtzmanomyces. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that cells are globose to ovoid and small and rarely exceed 9 $\mu$m in length. Reproduction is by budding and by production of blastoconidia at the end of a stalk-like conidiophore. The stalked blastoconidia are freed without forceful ejection at the distal end of the stalklike conidiophore. Each conidiophore can produce sequential multiple blastoconidia, thus becoming branched or elongated. Ballistoconidia can be formed in some species. Cultures are light orange in color. In sexual reproduction it is found that although the sexual state of the three species in Kurtzmanomyces is not known, a fourth (and sexual) species, Mycogloea nipponica, is closely related to Kurtzmanomyces and produces a Kurtzmanomyces-like anamorph. In nature, M. nipponica produces minute, light orange basidiocarps. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Kurtzmanomyces nectairei. Relevant physiological tests for the discrimination of species in the genus Kurtzmanomyces are presented. In the systematic discussion of the species, growth on 5\% malt extract agar, Dalmau plate culture on corn meal agar, gene sequence accession number, type strain, systematics, ecology, and origin of the strain studied are determined.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter studies the genus Cyniclomyces. In the determination of asexual reproduction, cells are long-ovoid to cylindrical and divide by budding at the poles or at the shoulders of the parent cell. In liquid media, cells occur in branched chains, but on solid media the cells occur mainly singly or in pairs. In sexual reproduction it is seen that ascospores are ovoid to cylindrical and one to four are formed in each ascus. Asci are unconjugated and usually persistent. Upon germination, an exosporium separates from the ascospores. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that fermentation of sugars is weak. Growth only occurs between 30 and 40{\textdegree}C and requires amino acids, B vitamins, and an increased level of atmospheric CO2. Cells are usually short-lived at room temperature or higher. Coenzyme Q-6 is formed. The diazonium blue B reaction is negative. The phylogenetic placement where phylogenetic analysis of multiple gene sequences places Cyniclomyces basal to the Saccharomycetaceae is also examined in this chapter. The type of species mentioned and accepted is Cyniclomyces guttulatus. The systematic discussion of the species includes growth on 1\% yeast autolysate, 1\% proteose peptone, 2\% glucose agar (pH 4.5) with 15\% CO2, growth in 1\% yeast autolysate, 1\% proteose peptone, 2\% glucose broth (pH 4.5), growth on the surface of liquid media, formation of ascospores, CoQ, Mol\% G1C, gene sequence accession number, NRRL Y-17561, cell carbohydrates, origin of the strains studied, type strain, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
In the determination of the asexual reproduction of Bulleribasidium, it is seen that the yeast cells are ovoid and budding is polar. Ballistoconidia are formed and are rotationally symmetrical. Cultures are yellowish-cream in color. In sexual reproduction it is found that the sexual structures are formed in the filamentous state. The hyphae have incomplete clamp connections but form haustorial branches. The sexual state is only observed in culture, and basidiocarps are not formed. Basidia are typically transversely septate and occasionally longitudinally septate and are arranged in small clusters or occur in isolation. The basidiospores are produced at the apex of tubular sterigmata and are forcibly discharged. They are globose, rotationally symmetrical, and germinate by budding or repetition. The septal pore is a dolipore with poorly developed parenthesome-like elements. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Bulleribasidium oberjochense. The salient features of Bulleribasidium are the formation of a transversely septate and two-celled basidium, combined with the formation of ballistoconidia in the yeast state. A Bulleribasidium-like life cycle might be hypothesized for the closest asexual relatives of B. oberjochense presently classified in Bullera.},

We have identified a number of diploid Saccharomyces cerevisiae clones that have undergone loss of heterozygosity (LOH) leading to functional inactivation of the hemizygous URA3 marker placed on the right arm of chromosome III. Aberrant-sized chromosomes derived from chromosome III were detected in [{\textasciitilde}]8\% of LOH clones. Here, we have analyzed the structure of the aberrant chromosomes in 45 LOH clones with a PCR-based method that determines the ploidy of a series of loci on chromosome III. The alterations included various deletions and amplifications. Sequencing of the junctions revealed that all the breakpoints had been made within repeat sequences in the yeast genome, namely, MAT-HMR, which resulted in intrachromosomal deletion, and retrotransposon Ty1 elements, which were involved in various translocations. Although the translocations involved different breakpoints on different chromosomes, all breakpoints were exclusively within Ty1 elements. Some of the resulting Ty1 elements left at the breakpoints had a complex construction that indicated the involvement of other Ty1 elements not present at the parental breakpoints. These indicate that Ty1 elements are crucially involved in the generation of chromosomal rearrangements in diploid yeast cells.},

This chapter studies the genus Kluyveromyces. In the determination of asexual reproduction, multilateral budding occurs on a narrow base. Cells are ovoid, ellipsoid, cylindrical, or elongate. Pseudohyphae may be formed, but true hyphae are not produced. In sexual reproduction it is seen that conjugation may or may not precede ascus formation. The ascospores are smooth, reniform, bacilliform, ellipsoidal, or spherical and tend to agglutinate after liberation. One to four ascospores are formed per ascus. In physiology and biochemistry it is seen that glucose is fermented vigorously by most species. This study further examines the phylogenetic placement. The type of species mentioned is Kluyveromyces marxianus. The species accepted are Kluyveromyces aestuarii, Kluyveromyces dobzhanskii, Kluyveromyces lactis, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Kluyveromyces nonfermentans, and Kluyveromyces wickerhamii. The systematic discussion of the species includes synonyms, growth on YM agar, growth in glucose yeast extract broth, Dalmau plate culture on corn meal agar, CoQ, Mol\% G1C, gene sequence accession number, type strain, cell carbohydrates, formation of ascospores, origin of the strains studied, complementary mating types, systematics, ecology, biotechnology, agriculture and food, and clinical importance.},

Eighty-five percent of insertions were solo long terminal repeats (LTRs) or LTR fragments. Overall, retrotransposon sequences constitute {\textgreater}377 kb or 3.1\% of the genome. Independent evolution of retrotransposon sequences was evidenced by the identification of a single-base pair insertion/deletion that distinguishes the highly similar Ty1 and Ty2 LTRs and the identification of a distinct Ty1 subfamily (Ty1'). Whereas Ty1, Ty2, and Ty5 LTRs displayed a broad range of sequence diversity (typically ranging from 70\%-99\% identity), Ty3 and Ty4 LTRs were highly similar within each element family (most sharing {\textgreater}96\% nucleotide identity). Therefore, Ty3 and Ty4 may be more recent additions to the S. cerevisiae genome and perhaps entered through horizontal transfer or past polyploidization events. Distribution of Ty elements is distinctly nonrandom: 90\% of Ty1, 82\% of Ty2, 95\% of Ty3, and 88\% of Ty4 insertions were found within 750 bases of tRNA genes or other genes transcribed by RNA polymerase III. tRNA genes are the principle determinant of retrotransposon distribution, and there is, on average, 1.2 insertions per tRNA gene. Evidence for recombination was found near many Ty elements, particularly those not associated with tRNA gene targets. For these insertions, 5'- and 3'-flanking sequences were often duplicated and rearranged among multiple chromosomes, indicating that recombination between retrotransposons can influence genome organization. S. cerevisiae offers the first opportunity to view organizational and evolutionary trends among retrotransposons at the genome level, and we hope our compiled data will serve as a starting point for further investigation and for comparison to other, more complex genomes.},

	abstract = {During meiotic recombination in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, heteroduplex DNA is formed when single-stranded DNAs from two homologues anneal as a consequence of strand invasion. If the two DNA strands differ in sequence, a mismatch will be generated. Mismatches in heteroduplex DNA are recognized and repaired efficiently by meiotic DNA mismatch repair systems. Components of two meiotic systems, mismatch repair (MMR) and large loop repair (LLR), have been identified previously, but the substrate range of these repair systems has never been defined. To determine the substrates for the MMR and LLR repair pathways, we constructed insertion mutants at HIS4 that form loops of varying sizes when complexed with wild-type HIS4 sequence during meiotic heteroduplex DNA formation. We compared the frequency of repair during meiosis in wild-type diploids and in diploids lacking components of either MMR or LLR. We find that the LLR pathway does not act on single-stranded DNA loops of less than 16 nucleotides in length. We also find that the MMR pathway can act on loops up to 17, but not great than 19, nucleotides in length, indicating that during meiosis the two pathways overlap slightly in their substrate range. Our data reveal differences in mitotic and meiotic MMR and LLR; these may be due to alterations in the functioning of each complex, or result from subtle sequence context influences on repair of the various mismatches examined.},

	abstract = {Antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is often due to the acquisition of resistance genes from a shared pool. In multiresistant isolates these genes, together with associated mobile elements, may be found in complex conglomerations on plasmids or on the chromosome. Analysis of available sequences reveals that these multiresistance regions (MRR) are modular, mosaic structures composed of different combinations of components from a limited set arranged in a limited number of ways. Components common to different MRR provide targets for homologous recombination, allowing these regions to evolve by combinatorial evolution, but our understanding of this process is far from complete. Advances in technology are leading to increasing amounts of sequence data, but currently available automated annotation methods usually focus on identifying ORFs and predicting protein function by homology. In MRR, where the genes are often well characterized, the challenge is to identify precisely which genes are present and to define the boundaries of complete and fragmented mobile elements. This review aims to summarize the types of mobile elements involved in multiresistance in Gram-negative bacteria and their associations with particular resistance genes, to describe common components of MRR and to illustrate methods for detailed analysis of these regions.},

	abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter discusses the genus Colacogloea. It provides a systematic discussion of the species and concludes with comments on the genus. The diagnosis of the genus is done on the basis of asexual, sexual, physiology and biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement. In asexual reproduction yeast cells are subglobose to ovoid or allantoid. Ballistoconidia are not formed. The cultures are cream colored and mucoid. Clamped hyphae can sometimes be formed in culture. In sexual reproduction Colacogloea is mycoparasitic, and the sexual state develops only in the host. Except for C. papilionacea, the species of this genus are found in association with fructifications of Polyporales (e.g., Hyphoderma praetermissum, species of Odontia, Peniophora, Poria, and Tubulicrinis). The basidiocarps are minute, pulvinate to effused, and mucoid-gelatinous. They are formed in and on the surface of host hymenia. Basidia do not have conspicuous probasidia and are transversely three-septate at maturity. Each basidial cell develops one long, tubular sterigma. Basidiospores are forcefully ejected and germinate by repetition or budding. They are thin-walled, smooth, and hyaline. A conidial budding yeast stage can be produced directly by conidiophores in the mycelium or by basidiospore germination. In the hyphae the septal pore is {\textquotedblleft}simple{\textquotedblright} and has no neighboring electron-opaque structures. The cellular connection between the parasite and the host is a special type of organelle for which the name colacosome was introduced. Cells of the parasite that attach to the host cells form distinct vesicular bodies with electron-dense cores and electron-transparent marginal regions.},

This chapter studies the genus Wickerhamia. In the determination of the asexual reproduction it is seen that the cells are ovoid to elongate or apiculate and divide by bipolar budding on a broad base. Neither pseudohyphae nor true hyphae are formed. In sexual reproduction it is found that the asci are unconjugated and form1{\textendash}2 or, rarely, up to 16 cap-shaped ascospores that are released by ascus deliquescence. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus, which states that the sugars are fermented, but relatively few carbon compounds on standard assimilation tests are utilized. Nitrate is not assimilated in this, coenzyme Q-9 is produced, and the diazonium blue B reaction is negative. The type species taken is Wickerhamia fluorescens. The four teleomorphic ascomycetous genera are characterized by bipolar budding: Hanseniaspora, Saccharomycodes, Nadsonia, and Wickerhamia. Two of the genera, Hanseniaspora and Saccharomycodes, are shown from gene sequence comparisons to be closely related genera of the Saccharomycodaceae, a sister family of the Saccharomycetaceae.},

This chapter studies the genus Saccharomycopsis. In the determination of the asexual reproduction, abundant development of true mycelium, often with blastoconidia, is seen. Budding is multilateral, and buds may be formed on a broad or a narrow base. Arthroconidia are produced by some species. Hyphal septa are usually multiperforate, but a single central pore may occur as well. In sexual reproduction it is found that the asci are usually attached to hyphae and produce one to four or, rarely, eight ascospores. Ascospores may be hat-shaped, reniform with terminal appendages, spherical, or ellipsoidal and may have one or more ledges; surfaces may be smooth or roughened. Species may be homothallic or heterothallic. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus. The type species taken is Saccharomycopsis.

The ability to grow in preserved food and feed environments is due to its capacity to grow under low pH, high osmotic pressure and low oxygen tension. A new application of P. anomala is its use as a biocontrol agent, which is based on the potential to inhibit a variety of moulds in different environments. Although classified as a biosafety class-1 organism, cases of P. anomala infections have been reported in immunocompromised patients. On the other hand, P. anomala killer toxins have a potential as antimicrobial agents. The yeast can use a broad range of nitrogen and phosphor sources, which makes it a potential agent to decrease environmental pollution by organic residues from agriculture. However, present knowledge of the physiological basis of its performance is limited. Recently, the first studies have been published dealing with the global regulation of the metabolism of P. anomala under different conditions of oxygenation.},

	abstract = {Many yeast strains are difficult to maintain in culture in a stable state, and long-term preservation by lyophilization, which has proved useful for other fungi, has given poor results with brewing yeasts. As an alternative to continuous subculture, which maximizes strain variability, various methods of cryogenic storage were investigated. Yeast strains were frozen with or without cryoprotectants (such as glycerol or inositol) and stored at -196 C. Recovery after warming was estimated from plate counts, and survivors were screened to detect changes in the frequency of morphological types, respiratory-deficient mutants, and glycerol-sensitive mutants. Strains varied in their sensitivity to freezing, and survival was modified by the growth medium, the freezing munstrua, and the freezing conditions. Suspension of cells in 10\% (vol/vol) glycerol, cooled at 1 C/min, warmed rapidly and plated on malt-yeast extract-glucose-peptone agar produced the highest percentage of viable colonies with a minimal change in metabolic characteristics. In two of the strains tested, no significant increase in mutation rate was detected under any of the treatments; the strains were maintained in a stable state and were metabolically comparable to unfrozen strains. In one strain of Saccharomyces uvarum after some freezing treatments, the percentage of respiratory-deficient mutants increased markedly, the fermentation rate declined, and a loss of flocculation occurred. The freezing parameters which increased the level of respiratory-deficient cells should be avoided in maintaining this strain. Maintenance of cultures of brewing yeasts by cryogenic storage has several advantages over other preservation techniques: the method is simple and reproducible, the cultures have remained stable over a 3-year test period, and the viability is high.},

	abstract = {Centromeres have many unusual biological properties, including kinetochore attachment and severe repression of local meiotic recombination. These properties are partly an outcome, partly a cause, of unusual DNA structure in the centromeric region. Although several plant and animal genomes have been sequenced, most centromere sequences have not been completed or analyzed in depth. To shed light on the unique organization, variability, and evolution of centromeric DNA, detailed analysis of a 1.97-Mb sequence that includes centromere 8 (CEN8) of japonica rice was undertaken. Thirty-three long-terminal repeat (LTR)-retrotransposon families (including 11 previously unknown) were identified in the CEN8 region, totaling 245 elements and fragments that account for 67\% of the region. The ratio of solo LTRs to intact elements in the CEN8 region is \{approx\}0.9:1, compared with \{approx\}2.2:1 in noncentromeric regions of rice. However, the ratio of solo LTRs to intact elements in the core of the CEN8 region (\{approx\}2.5:1) is higher than in any other region investigated in rice, suggesting a hotspot for unequal recombination. Comparison of the CEN8 region of japonica and its orthologous segments from indica rice indicated that \{approx\}15\% of the intact retrotransposons and solo LTRs were inserted into CEN8 after the divergence of japonica and indica from a common ancestor, compared with \{approx\}50\% for previously studied euchromatic regions. Frequent DNA rearrangements were observed in the CEN8 region, including a 212-kb subregion that was found to be composed of three rearranged tandem repeats. Phylogenetic analysis also revealed recent segmental duplication and extensive rearrangement and reshuffling of the CentO satellite repeats.},

	abstract = {The extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of bacterial biofilms form a hydrated barrier between cells and their external environment. Better characterization of EPS could be useful in understanding biofilm physiology. The EPS are chemically complex, changing with both bacterial strain and culture conditions. Previously, we reported that Pseudomonas aeruginosa unsaturated biofilm EPS contains large amounts of extracellular DNA (eDNA) (R. E. Steinberger, A. R. Allen, H. G. Hansma, and P. A. Holden, Microb. Ecol. 43:416-423, 2002). Here, we investigated the compositional similarity of eDNA to cellular DNA, the relative quantity of eDNA, and the terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) community profile of eDNA in multiple-species biofilms. By randomly amplified polymorphic DNA analysis, cellular DNA and eDNA appear identical for P. aeruginosa biofilms. Significantly more eDNA was produced in P. aeruginosa and Pseudomonas putida biofilms than in Rhodococcus erythropolis or Variovorax paradoxus biofilms. While the amount of eDNA in dual-species biofilms was of the same order of magnitude as that of of single-species biofilms, the amounts were not predictable from single-strain measurements. By the Shannon diversity index and principle components analysis of TRFLP profiles generated from 16S rRNA genes, eDNA of four-species biofilms differed significantly from either cellular or total DNA of the same biofilm. However, total DNA- and cellular DNA-based TRFLP analyses of this biofilm community yielded identical results. We conclude that extracellular DNA production in unsaturated biofilms is species dependent and that the phylogenetic information contained in this DNA pool is quantifiable and distinct from either total or cellular DNA.},

This heterogeneity may affect levels of diversity, efficiency of selection, and genome composition, as well as have practical consequences for the genetic mapping of traits. We compared the genetic maps to the genome sequence assemblies of rat, mouse, and human to estimate local recombination rates across these genomes. Humans have greater overall levels of recombination, as well as greater variance. In rat and mouse, the size of the chromosome and proximity to telomere have less effect on local recombination rate than in human. At the chromosome level, rat and mouse X chromosomes have the lowest recombination rates, whereas human chromosome X does not show the same pattern. In all species, local recombination rate is significantly correlated with several sequence variables, including GC\%, CpG density, repetitive elements, and the neutral mutation rate, with some pronounced differences between species. Recombination rate in one species is not strongly correlated with the rate in another, when comparing homologous syntenic blocks of the genome. This comparative approach provides additional insight into the causes and consequences of genomic heterogeneity in recombination.},

Both yeast and hyphal states occur. In the yeast state, the cells are ovoid to elongate and reproduce by budding; pseudohyphae may be present. In sexual reproduction teliospores are terminal or intercalary on the hyphae. Yeast cells are uninucleate and produce uninucleate teliospore-bearing hyphae without clamp connections. Teliospore germination results in phragmo- or holometabasidia. This study further discusses physiology, biochemistry, and phylogenetic placement.

Until now, the unavailability of wild lineages prevented the identification of the closest wild relatives of wine yeasts. Here, we enlarge the collection of natural lineages and employ whole-genome data of oak-associated wild isolates to study a balanced number of anthropic and natural S.~cerevisiae strains. We identified industrial variants and new geographically delimited populations, including a novel Mediterranean oak population. This population is the closest relative of the wine lineage as shown by a weak population structure and further supported by genomewide population analyses. A coalescent model considering partial isolation with asymmetrical migration, mostly from the wild group into the Wine group, and population growth, was found to be best supported by the data. Importantly, divergence time estimates between the two populations agree with historical evidence for winemaking. We show that three horizontally transmitted regions, previously described to contain genes relevant to wine fermentation, are present in the Wine group but not in the Mediterranean oak group. This represents a major discontinuity between the two populations and is likely to denote a domestication fingerprint in wine yeasts. Taken together, these results indicate that Mediterranean oaks harbour the wild genetic stock of domesticated wine yeasts.},

We use coalescent simulations to show that the likelihood-ratio test statistic is conservative, particularly when the assumption of no recombination is violated. Application of the method to polymorphism data from 18 loci from a population of Arabidopsis lyrata provides significant evidence for a balanced polymorphism at a candidate locus thought to be linked to the centromere.

This chapter studies the genus Blastobotrys. In the asexual reproduction colonies are restricted, dry, dull, snow-white, cream, or tannish and consist of appressed hyphal growth. Budding cells are absent or present. Conidiophores are suberect, sympodial, and produce conidia in clusters on a rachis or alongside hyphae. Conidia are born on pedicels or denticles or are sessile. Primary conidia produce smaller, secondary conidia, either synchronously or sympodially in short, acropetal chains; primary conidia often bear setae. Septa have micropores. In sexual reproduction it is found that Trichomonascus represents the teleomorphic state of Blastobotrys. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which sugars are often fermented, nitrate is assimilated by some species, coenzyme Q-9 is produced, and the diazonium blue B reaction is negative. The type species taken is Blastobotrys nivea. The genus Blastobotrys, which may bud sparingly or not at all, was originally treated as a hyphomycete, and it was believed to be closely related to the genus Sporothrix from which it was distinguished on morphological criteria. However, members of Blastobotrys, as well as some Sporothrix species, were found to contain mannose as the predominant cell carbohydrate, whereas rhamnose and xylose were absent.},

This chapter studies the genus Yarrowia. Aasexual reproduction is by multilateral budding on a narrow base. Arthroconidia may also be formed. Budded cells are spherical, ellipsoidal, or often elongate. True hyphae and pseudohyphae are formed; true hyphae have septa with a single central micropore. In sexual reproduction it is found that the asci are unconjugated and generally arise from diploid hyphae. The asci, which slowly deliquesce, form one to four ascospores that may be spherical, hat-shaped, hemispheroidal, or somewhat angular. The single described species is heterothallic. The chapter also discusses physiology/biochemistry and phylogenetic placement of the genus in which sugars are not fermented, nitrate is not assimilated, and lipases and proteases are produced. Coenzyme Q-9 is formed and the diazonium blue B reaction is negative. The type species taken is Yarrowia lipolytica. Yarrowia lipolytica, the only described species of the genus Yarrowia, is widespread in nature and has considerable industrial utility as well as importance to the food and medical fields.},
